### About
This is Team 11's Data Science Mini-Project, which focuses on the [glassdoor reviews](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm) on [ALDI](https://www.aldi.co.uk/), a German supermarket brand in the UK. <br> 
In the source code, you can expect the following: 
1. Introduction
2. Data Cleaning
3. Visualisation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Linear Regression
5. Random Forest Classifier
6. Logistic Regression
7. Findings and Conclusion

### Problem Definition:
Using a dataset on company reviews from Kaggle, we use EDA and Machine Learning to find out:
1. How can ALDI better improve its ratings?
2. How has ALDI's workplace evolve over the time?

### Conclusion
- ALDI's company benefits has the lowest linear correlation value, while ALDI's culture values has the highest linear correlation value with overall ratings 
- Random Forest gave good results for a first sample (around 60% accuracy), and exhibit results that align with our linear regression
- Logistic Regression did not perform well with Glassdoor's categorical metric system

### Answers to our problem:
1. Maintain strong culture values and capable senior management together to continually improve ratings while possibly improving employee retention.
2. Company benefits increased over the years, whereas every other metric remained average and stagnant. ALDI employees has poor work-life-balance.

### What did we learn from this project?
- Collaborating using GitHub 
- Use of Linear Regression to better show correlation between variables
- Random Forest on numerical variables
- Use of Hyperparameter tuning on Random Forest
- Logistic Regression on categorical variables
- The use of pandas get_dummies to convert categorical to indicator variables
