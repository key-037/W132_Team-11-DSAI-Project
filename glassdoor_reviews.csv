AFH-Wealth-Management,27/6/2017, Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,5,5,5,,4,5,4,v,o,v,Great place to work,"- I was made to feel very welcome when I first started and I was never made to feel like I was a 'burden' or an 'inconvenience' to train. I work in admin and although I have 8 years previous experience working within an admin based role prior to starting work at AFH, I had never worked within the finance industry - so there has been a lot to learn, but I have enjoyed learning something new every day!
- Management enable new recruits to learn at their own pace and facilitate their own style of learning when training up new people for their role. AFH provide ongoing product knowledge refresher training, So, if something doesn't 'click' the first time around, you may well understand it much better after having some hands on experience in your new role & sitting in the refresher training session again.
- Knowing that through my work I'm able to assist other people, whether that's clients, co-workers, the advisers, supervisors or management; providing information needed and answering questions - to me that is the one of the biggest pros, job satisfaction.
- Knowing that management trust me to use my own initiative to create & implement new strategies whilst working on large projects.
- There are great possibilities of advancing your career and moving within the business.
- Management acknowledging your efforts and going out of their way to thank you when you have worked hard.
- Treated with respect and kindness & feel valued as an employee. 
- Fast-paced environment, never a dull moment and the time at work flies by!
- Great benefits package.
- Supportive and friendly co-workers.
- Lovely office building to work in.
- The list of pros could go on & on... but I'd be here all day. I love my job and the company.","- Occasionally (as there is in all jobs) there are challenges or situations that can be a little stressful; however, on saying that, the camaraderie within the teams really is great, we all endeavour to help each other through challenging times and work as a team to get the job done."

Regularly throughout the year, the CEO and head of HR meet with a representative from each team in the Employee forum. They listen to ideas and ways to improve things from staff across the company.

The staff within each department are lovely and you can make some great friends for life here.,"I genuinely believe AFH have a good offering for clients and try to put their best interests at the heart of the business decisions however in doing so they have completely forgotten about the staff who are the people that provide that back office service to clients. If your staff are happy, feel well cared for, listened to and fairly remunerated for what they do then they will respect the company and want to deliver a service to the best of their ability. If you don’t do these things, which unfortunately is the case at AFH, the reverse is true. They focus too much on ‘cheap labour’ and harbour an atmosphere of ‘us and them’ between senior management and staff. I genuinely believe the CEO wants to do right by the staff but he is surrounded by yes people who shelter him from what’s really happening on the office floor. They don’t look after their own, people who have been loyal to the company for many years, other than those who have made it to a seat at the board table. When it comes to promotions, they prefer to recruit externally rather than those with experience who have worked their way through the ranks which is often a cause of frustration for staff who keep being promised their next promotion is just around the corner. HR is a shambles and you wouldn’t want to tell them anything remotely confidential otherwise it’s round the office as gossip in no time at all. They certainly don’t want people who will challenge the order of things or suggest a new way of thinking. It is a shame as I think the company has a lot of potential but unfortunately, despite beating you over the head about being ‘the employer of choice’, right now they are anything but. The company is growing rapidly but unless they do something soon about the multitude of unhappy staff (I interacted with all the departments in the business and almost every single person felt the same way), the entire back office support system will collapse and they won’t have any long term, knowledgeable or experienced staff to hold the business up."
AFH-Wealth-Management,11/12/2018, Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,5,5,5,,5,5,5,v,o,v,Supremacy,"Great place to have a career. I joined fresh out of university nearly 7 years ago. The company has been on an amazing growth journey, certainly since then which it has been a privilidge to be a part of. The below is a list of the benefits to me personally, and is not exhaustive.

-Scope for career progression to those that demonstrate the hunger and the skills required. It must be noted that you need to be realistic with your ambitions and a career is a career and not an overnight process. AFH reward loyalty, and if you demonstate the right abilities and attributes for more senior positions, combined with becoming an experienced team member and obtaining any examinations (if required), you will find yourself climbing up the career progression scale and experience the benefits that come with that increased responsibility. 
-Full financial support for relevant examinations which are approved by your line manager. I have had many exams and material paid for over the years which has supported me a lot and has always been fully appreciated. 
-The staff. Amazing, friendly people throughout the business and many friends for life who I have met through working there both past and present workers. This makes a working day so much better when you have good people around you.
-Package aside from salary includes pension, a reasonable amount of healthcare (primarily dental and optical) and an annual bonus. There have been sweeteners in the past e.g. share options which for a growing company can be extremely lucrative. There is also a really attractive tiered loyalty bonus scheme which if in it for the long haul can be very welcoming. 
-Social aspect is really good. Christmas party, summer ball, summer BBQ, and annual charity football match to name a few.
-AFH sponsor a charity each year and there are many interesting events throughout the year which staff are invited to join in on from conquering Snowdon, running in Birmingham 10k, skydives, pub quiz or just good old bake offs.
-Compressed working pattern offered to certain workers (not all). A benefit I consume and it’s something that is not easy to put a price on. A working week compressed into 4 days allowing for the same rate of pay, but 3 days off in a working week instead of 2. Something I put a high value on personally.","I genuinely have no cons to working here. You get out what you put in. Over time, if you demonstate the right attributes, skills, attitude and work ethic this will be rewarded."

The benefits on top of your salary could be a desired addition to your employment, however, most people do not use said benefits so they are effectively nul and void.","The environment is extrememely biased in that if you are one of the chosen ones then your time there can be rewarding and enjoyable, however, if you are professional, accomplished and have experience from working in other estsblishments then you are seen as 'not the AFH way'.
The senior managment leave a lot to be desired. Most people there will hinder your career as opposed to progress it as it is a vindictive and malicious environment. The salary accross the board is undesirable in that 2 people could be doing the same role and the favoured party will be paid considerably more as they are a 'yes person' and most likely affraid to challenge for positive and productive outcomes. Contempt breeds with endless gossip. 
The investment ethos also leaves a lot to be desired and many other investment companies in the midlands have better returns in comparison and therefore are better businesses in practice.
The position that I carried out allowed me to gain knowledge of the business and its employees from a higher level of access and I am qualified to say that my comments are knowledgable and accurate.

If you're lucky enough to get a parking spot in town (waiting list) - this is the most valuable benefit on offer (no really - financially the parking space is worth more than the pension). Easy life if you live locally.,"Pay in the Tunbridge Wells office matches the pay in the Manchester office so is CONSIDERABLY below market. I TRIPLED my salary within a year of leaving. Progression is limited and there is rampant favouritism and cronyism. No Salary bands are provided either so there is severe opaqueness in pay structure, which inevitably leads to huge turnover (over 30% in 2014, I believe) when people do learn of colleague's salaries.

The benefits, particularly the pension (3% matched - which by the way will be mandatory for all firms in 2018), are so terrible such that tea-making facilities are listed as a benefit on the employment contract. Ironic how bad the pension is, given that pensions form a large part of business. Other benefits: Death in Service (but only 3x). Town centre car parking, but there is waiting list of around a year. That's it.

They do offer to pay for training for the most basic qualification (the IOC), but very inflexible for additional training. They refused to allow me take time off for to do the study course for highly recognised CISI Diploma even though, because they refused to pay for it, I had forked out £1500 for it. They insisted time off for study come out of holiday!

Massive dislocation between the Tunbridge Wells (TW) and Manchester (HQ) offices. TW office ignored by the head honchos in Manchester as a satellite office, but still didn't have any autonomy (there was no single individual in charge of the 120+ staff at the TW office). Very disjointed management structures. HR were very disinterested and Senior Management are worse. When there were three consecutive years of poor results on the annual Times Best Companies survey - management told the junior staff and team leaders to identify the specific issues causing the disgruntlement, work out some solutions and report their findings to management (to implement, if they felt like it). Senior  Management didn't get involved until all the work had aleady been done!

There were also a lot of recurring problems,e.g. Data Protection Breaches that were being reported to the Board on a monthly basis, but the Board rarely, if ever, did anything about them. There was no top-down reinforcement of culture as the Board had no interest in the day-to-day running of what is still quite a small business, nor the staff."

Has handled the COVID situation remarkably well considering WFH was never an option for anyone below management previously as it was not believed it would be possible across the board, they have proven themselves wrong and adapted very quickly offering a lot of support and have not been afraid to provide the resource required to make it possible.","Salary, although advertised as competitive, often falls short of the mark when compared to market competitors which can create a level of dissatisfaction within the workforce.
Pay progression is also slow with little clarity on how to move up the pay scale. This is not helped by emails often sent by the board advertising how profitable the company is continuing to be.
Despite being a relatively young company some of the views and attitudes held higher in the company can sometimes be a little Dickensian with regards to feedback and criticism."

The low bar for staff entry means you can get your first experience in Financial Services before moving on to a company that actually protects and values its staff. My advice to anyone looking to work at AJ Bell is to use it as a stepping stone in your career. Get the experience, and the name on your CV, then get out.","First the minor points:
- Poor salary, consistently under industry averages for virtually every position in the business.
- Poor benefits, awful pension contributions for a company founded on pension business
- The company regularly promise improvements which never arrive, particularly the pay levelling of staff which ended up falling short.
- Very poor access to industry training, unless it makes the company compliant. Almost constant need for internal courses, though.

The major failings:
- HR department which is not fit for purpose, with ill-defined processes leading them to make things up as they go.
- Any time off you take is weighed up using the Bradford Factor and used against you, so there’s almost a fear of being ill.
- Sexist language is heard frequently, as are inappropriately sexual jokes. But, it's to be expected given the example set when Heads of Department are sleeping with their direct reports.
- Aggressive behaviour and language are commonplace. But they’re seen as signs of ambition rather than yet another troubling sign of a toxic masculine culture.
- Even more troublesome is the many stories of sexual harassment which are common knowledge, none of which seem to result in action against those men involved."

The salaries at this company across the board are very low compared to their competitors. The bonus is also extremely low and you have to constantly justify to your manager why you are entitled to a bonus in end of year reviews.

Salary increases are not actual salary increases they are just in line with inflation. Salary and bonus are not determined by your level of effort at all. No overtime pay ever available. Effort is therefore not rewarded at all at AJ Bell, you shall receive the same pay for whatever effort you put in.

Management

Management have little to no knowledge of the financial services industry whatsoever. They are just told by upper management to manage by fear and constantly harass and bully staff to work longer hours which is due to constantly being understaffed. 

Management also alter MI so that it shows a team is performing well when it isn’t which is lying to upper management. 

Culture

Some areas better than others but overall there is a serious issue at AJ Hell from managers to make decisions from fear of getting blamed. This creates an awkward environment where teams aren’t run properly. This is done so that they can then blame their staff members to avoid any accountability and use them as scape goats if anything goes very wrong.

Promotions

Promotions are never given to people who deserve them. AJ Hell is very backwards in the way that you can only get promoted if a vacancy arises for that position and not down to merit. 

IT systems

The systems are a complete joke there are always issues. IT are nice and friendly but have very little knowledge to solve issues. IT issues can remain unresolved for months as they can just open and close “calls” so it appears as though your issues are resolved.

Overall:

Good place to start your career or use as a stepping stone to advance your career."

After being offered the job you realise quickly you’ve been given a position in the  overworked scapegoat department. 

Pay variance- it’s massive between us some admins. Although it’s top secret, you are not suppose to discuss what you get paid. If you happen to be paid more that the threshold, you are burdened with that responsibility your whole career.  No pay rises, annual increases even if you’re promoted! It becomes your fault someone actually paid you a decent wage. 

You are just a number, easily replaced and not valued. 

Never go against the gain- you’ll be as branded defector all your career. Feedback or pointing out areas of improvement goes against the totalitarian regime. 

Good people leave or randomly disappear- it happens a lot! 

Overworked- volumes are through the roof. None of the senior management have any concepts of the levels of work the teams are experiencing. It becomes very apparent when people leave and are replaced with two people (doing their position)  , how much they actually contributed. But to Senior Management you are just a number, easily replaceable, they don’t care! 

Goodwill is taken for granted .AJ Hell believe you should freely give this away and rely so heavily on this that people burn out very quickly. Though their goodwill is never shared.

MI- Senior management clown about in the boardroom, peakcocking about their made up MI stats in order to inflate their own ego! While the board clap their performance and the truth about their departments  is swept under the carpet.  

Overtime- you won’t get paid. This is where you are forcefully volunteering your services to help the rich people of AJ Hell get richer. Remember doing your bit for the corporate community service here! 

Don’t appreciate or recognise your service- one person apparently got a framed picture of them for working there 15 years. I’m sure a mirror would have been perfectly sufficient. Another said they got sandwiches made by a director for their 10 year anniversary and made to go on lunch with them. All thrilling experiences I hope. 

Best companies- very precious about this. Around a month before the release of the survey team leaders/ management turn into Gollum corrupted by a score for their area. Managers gave you a biscuit and let you sit at their desk when completing the survey. Like that’s what your aspirations in life are! 

Going for a promotion is a lot like being judged at Cruffs. They judge you on your appearance, how you parade round the office and how obedient you are to them.

IT systems are basically just pimped up fisher price computers. I once called IT as all the banks of desks would not log on. I was told to email a screenshot of this to service  desk! 

Volunteering and raising money - always volunteering activities but some ways of the raising money were a bit seedy. I was never a fan of sitting on Santa’s (directors) laps and paying him for the privilege of my bottom being in contact with his legs, then receiving a celebration chocolate as a reward for my endeavours.

Freebies- we use to get an Easter egg each year, after  becoming a PLC times were hard and a couple of creme eggs were scattered among the department, in a bird seed type fashion. 

HR - there is nothing human about them, nor do they have the resources to actually do anything. It’s basically do as I say not as I do."

The people are what makes going to work bearable. Most people are friendly and approachable, even some of the senior managers. There's are a few added extras that are good:

holiday allowance. Now starts at 24 and increases per full company year to a max of 30 I think. 

free on-site gym. There isn't loads of equipment but there are classes morning lunch and after work.  (Obviously not open currently)

nice offices that are modern. 

some fantastic colleagues that actually become friends.","Progression. Yes you can progress if your face fits and you don't disagree with a decision from the top. They have a habit of promoting some shockingly bad people to managers just because their face fits, never mind if they can actually do the role. It's not the case in all departments but just the majority especially customer services.  People have been told outright not to apply for promotions as they want external candidates but then hire someone internal the week after. 

A fair go. The company currently utilises the government levy for apprenticeships and this includes team leader and management courses. To be put forward for this course is by the heads of departments. It's a very unfair way of doing it as what a head of department sees Vs managers or team leaders is very different. Again it's a face fits issue.  

lack of support. There is very little support whether it be with mental health (there are mental health first aiders but this isn't widely used nor promoted), issues with team members (allowing members of the team to be negative and disruptive without any ramifications. Most of the time they think it's easier to just ignore the issue) or external qualifications (the apprenticeships are meant to be on the job however there is very little time allocated to help them pass) . If you have issues, they are just swept under the rug. 

bonuses and pay. Essentially you get what your manager thinks you are worth. If they don't like you (again your face doesn't fit) they will penalise you using your bonus and pay. You could have worked your behind off all year and you wouldn't get anything whilst the disruptive person will get a lovely bonus and pay rise because the manager can't deal with the ear ache. The bonuses aren’t assessed fairly and they vary department by department. 

poor pension contributions. Considering that AJ Bell are a pension company and have won multiple industry awards, the pension contribution is shocking. 

Some members of HR and learning a development are very supportive but their hands do become tied. 

All in all its not a horrendous place to work and I have worked in worst places."

This combined with the ridiculously high turn over of staff means no-one ever knows what they're doing, mistakes are constantly made and the workload piles up for the few experienced staff members to have to deal with.
- AJ Bell ensure that you can only progress if you are having marital relations with one of the managers, or if they want to have marital relations with you. Hard work is not recognised or appreciated.
- It seems that bullying is widely accepted throughout the company as the HR team have absolutely no power or purpose. If an anonymous complaint is made about a particular manager then it will always get back to them & make the situation worse. There are no consequences to their actions until the bullied staff member decides they have no option but to leave.
- The directors only care about lining their pockets and company image to protect their share prices - there is such a huge push every year to ensure the company survey helps them reach the Times top 100 company list, and if staff members leave bad reviews then their Team Leaders are punished by having their annual bonus taken away.
- Despite the compulsory staff attended biannual meetings the Director holds to boast of the sheer increase of growth and profits, pay rises were denied in 2020 for the majority of staff (aside from upper management)."
ALDI,26/8/2008, Area Manager,Current Employee,"Portland, OR",2,3,,,2,4,3,x,o,o,"""Beware all that glistens ...""","Experience, responsibility and the pay.","Extremely long hours for the sector (70+ not uncommon) and stress created by steep performance expectations with few resources available to run operations. Aldi is a discounter wih increadible prices for the quality but achieves this in a number of ways, not least by keeping staffing levels very low and driving productivity rates to levels not seen elsewhere. 

This all sounds fine, but in reality it makes for a tough working environment where your hours make up for the lack of colleagues - a convenient cost saving for the company, which employes well motivated individuals to achieve this.  At store level breaks are often not taken, or simply cannot be taken if the store is too busy because there is simply no back up. Some stores may be staffed by only two people and both may be required on the cash tills if the store is busy, to the detriment of all other tasks that need to be undertaken in the store. This is fun and a buzz to begin with but the fun palls as the reality of your working life sinks in!  The turnover of staff is prodigious - both self selecting and by the axe for those who can't keep the pace.

At Area or District Manager level, keen, ambitious, motivated people are selected to join the training programme with a healthy carrot of promotion opportunities and sector beating pay.  If you are attracted by this do a bit of due diligence before accepting!  The sector beating pay comes in annual increments - it doesn't start off fantastically.  This gives Aldi a chance to vet you in role first.  Fair enough?  Area Managers in training are used to run stores in preparation for their promotion to fully trained area manager - this gives Aldi a fantastic resource of ambitious thrusters to be used to run difficult and often failing stores for less than the price of a fully trained store manager.  An additional company benefit is that AM's in training voluntarily work any hours required (store managers often do not - mindful of employment laws!) to run their stores and will travel to wherever the company requires them to work without complaint unlike store managers.  The loyalty is one way however - a large number of area managers in training are needed at any stage to fill roles in stores and because few will make the grade.  A few from any intake will make full Area Manager and a few from this group will be promoted to Director in time.  However the rest will usually 'leave' after a few years providing advancement opportunities for the next group of ambitious hard working talent.

In my 3 years I saw in excess of 30 people come and go to service 10 area manager positions.  The clue is in how frequently Aldi advertises in the recruitment pages for these roles!"

If you do as asked and contribute to team Aldi has a lot to offer. It's very team work orientated and if you help out your co-workers and vise versa everything works as it should. Weak links are quickly pointed out though they do compensate for new starters by having an extra team member on for a week or so cut pick up the slack.

The pay is ok, but you do work hard for it. Shifts are usually 6,8 and 10 hours starting from 6am on an early shift or until 9pm on a late. 

Days consist of working working deliveries (main, bread, chiller, freezer and produce) produce can be hard work at 6am let me tell you! Working on till which is like nothing else. You scan as quick as you can for hours on end whilst remember fruit, veg and various other product numbers. It's easier than it sounds as you pick up the numbers quickly on the job. Then there's carding which is basically tipping out what left in boxes and rearranging the shelves and putting the card in the compactor. Then there cleaning up on the late shift.

Providing you show your worth on the shop floor you will find your self on the tills less.


Contract was 20hrs minimum but I usually averaged 30-35 per week. You got one Saturday, one Sunday, one whole weekend, and worked one whole weekend per month plus days off in the week. No complaints.","The main point here is that you work HARD for your money. If you're lazy, like the odd skive, fancy a quick smoke...Forgot it, you will not last a week. 

It's physically demanding, expect to lift heavy loads throughout the day. If you're ok with this you'll be fine.

Sometimes finishing on time proves tricky. I'm unsure why this is but it annoyed me on a few occasions.

The staff I work with are great, including the managers, though obviously this could vary tremendously between stores and regions.
I'm never really bored at work. Angry, tired, happy... Sure, but never bored.","The rota can be an nightmare. Your shifts can vary so wildly from week to week that your sleep and social life will most definitely suffer. If you're a particularly social person and enjoy regular weekends out and being with friends you should forget about the job right now because I haven't had a weekend off in months. One morning you're up at 3am, the next you're not on until 2pm and so on... Basically it's very hard to have any kind of regularity in your free time because the rotas are so varied and inconsistent. 

There's also a lot of variation in the way staff are treated. The gents are expected to do more heavy lifting, more physical work and that's fine, sure, but they're also typically the last people to get the time off that they want. In my store it's all too easy for a girl to bat her eyelids and get whatever time off she likes. Likewise certain members of staff seem to get away with murder. They perpetually under perform (making more work for the rest) without any repercussions. 

There really isn't that much room for advancement. At best, after many years of thankless grafting you can make your way to store manager. The money at that level is good, yes, but in return you basically have to live in the store. If you've any ambition to make it into upper management you need to reconsider because there is no opportunity for store employees to advance to that level. They would rather employ people straight out of university.

My last little gripe is the uniform. The clothes are fine and good but men have to be clean shaven. This might not bother you at all but to me seems antiquated and discriminatory at best. There's no hygiene basis for it whatsoever. You are allowed facial hair for religious reasons though, which is almost more insulting. Beards are okay, basically, as long as you're the right race and skin colour."

I have worked for other retailers and Aldi are by far the worst.
When I started with the company I was working 40 hours per week, just what I wanted, but in the last few months my hours have been cut to around 24 hours per week, meaning that my outgoings are more than my take home pay. This is mainly due to a recent mass recruitment campaign where many stores have doubled their staff numbers, but hired too quickly and taken on many poor and incompetent staff.
The management do not care about staff, if you question any policy you are shot down and have your card marked as a complainer, meaning that you get your hours cut further and have even less chance of promotion.
The stores are really run by area managers who are usually 21 year olds fresh out of uni, who have no idea about retail and have never had a job. They have no personnel skills and no idea on how to treat or speak to staff.
Aldi will cut staff hours right back, but still expect you to be 100% flexible and will rota you to be off and then call you into work at the last minute. They will guilt trip you and you'll go to the bottom of the overtime list if you can't or won't come in to work.
The final straw came this week when staff were told that they would not be allowed to park in the shop car park over the 2 week xmas period, meaning staff now have to find a parking space elsewhere in a very run down area and will have to walk long distances to the shop.

I am expected to lift heavy objects from great heights, above my head height, and if I complain, I'm looked down on or guilt tripped with the ""this is a team and we all have to pull our weight"" speech, despite it being against health and safety regulations. My sleeping pattern has completely messed up with the 6AM starts one day and not starting until 2PM the next and working on until 3AM the next morning. The management tend to look down on people who are new starts or younger employees such as myself, especially if you're in some form of education as they seem to think that I must think I'm better than them for studying at college and only working part-time. I have been made to stay on past my finishing time almost every shift that I'm on without being asked, and if I ask to leave most times they point-blank refuse to let me go ""until all of the jobs are done"" and I'm not being paid for it. So this means I have no social life whatsoever and finding time to study has become increasingly difficult as I am tired all the time from work. I'm usually asked to pick up the slack for other people that haven't finished their tasks, and managers seem to have no qualms about patronizing and bullying you into it when you try and object. Despite complaining to my Store Manager about how I'm treated, nothing is being done about this. As someone who suffers from Anxiety Disorder, this has wreaked havoc on my mental well-being, and I'm currently applying for a new job after working for the company for almost 2 years."

ALDI,10/2/2015, Store Assistant,Current Employee,"Northampton, England, England",1,1,1,,1,1,1,x,r,o,Awful from the first day,It's not bad pay however that is the only benefit of working for the company.,"Where to begin?

On my first week of working as an Aldi Store assistant, I was treated so horribly. I was shouted at in front of customers as I made small mistakes due to members of staff near breathing down your neck as you try to get used to the tills. As I was young and quite shy, at first, they tried to push me further. Other employees didn't make me feel welcomed, the manager didn't even speak to me. It felt like higher up had forced the store to employ new people but the store and everyone in it was dead against new faces.
I remember on one of my first shifts, I walked home crying my eyes out because I couldn't believe I'd traded in my old job for somewhere so horrific.
The employees they told to train me, openly told me they didn't want to do training and were aggressive. It was like they wanted to scare me into quitting. They gave us a list of hundreds of PLUs and told us we had to learn a certain amount per night, I felt like I was being taught by Miss Trunchable from Matilda, no exaggeration.

Then there are the managers. In Aldi, there are LOADS of managers to every store and 99% of them are unprofessional, perverse and just in capable of managing. One particular manager would come in, his shirt unwashed, marks of food and rubbish down him, smelling. It was disgusting.
One manager would refer to me as ""sexy lady""... MANAGER. Once he even grabbed my shirt, pulled me into his face. I just didn't know what to do.
Another manager was forever angry, you'd think that being spoken to in a polite manner was a privilege reserved for birthdays. She would shout, scream, give you dirty looks and just on a whole, make you feel uncomfortable. Again, her hair was filled with grease and she was unpresentable, despite us new employees being warned that lack of presentation is an offence at Aldi. 

The store system on a whole is kind of like a hierarchy. You have the employees that are the same level as you but are clearly far more 'valued' than yourself. Without promotion, they were given manager keys, which is a sackable offence had they been caught by anyone higher up and would often throw it in your face. I had a number of these, 'elite team members' we'll call them, say to me ""We might be the same level, but I'm still higher"". 

They also make you feel guilty for being ill. During my time there, I got the chickenpox. God, you'd think I ordered them, they were so rude to me on the phone. 

In the end, I was signed off of work from my doctor who advised me to look for another job as I had to be put on medication for anxiety due to Aldi. 

I provided sick notes covering my absence but, low and behold, they didn't even pay me statutory sick pay in the end, which again is illegal.

I handed in my notice on the 10th of January and when that letter came through the post to say I officially didn't work for Aldi anymore, I literally could not have been any happier!! 

Honestly, unless all you care about is money and are happy to be treated like mess on the bottom of your shoe, I would highly recommend you work anywhere else but Aldi. 

You have to ask yourself, why do they need to take in so many staff if it's such a great place to work? Why are they constantly hiring? Why is everyone leaving? 

i thought it was just the store I got put in but reading this reviews it just seems across the board it's just in general an awful place to work."
ALDI,24/2/2015, Stock Assistant,Former Employee,"Syston, Leicestershire, East Midlands, England, England",1,1,1,,2,3,1,x,o,x,Utter joke,the pay is fairly good,"Handbook says arrive 15 mins early, be on shop floor for your start time- they actually expect you on shop floor 15 mins early. I recieved disciplinary for arriving 15 mins early and getting onto shop floor 10 mins before my start time. Deputy managers are just kids with no training/ management experience hence they act the big man because of their job title. Was told to speed up on my second day, even though i didnt know where the products go yet. my speed got faster but then recieved a disciplinary on my 2nd week for not being as fast as people who worked there for 9 months. Was told to come in at 8.30 am for an induction, but was actually there to be sacked for the disciplinary thing before i had even worked another shift after the diciplinary, so had no chance to even try to improve. Also worked 9 hours wihtout a break and yet 8 hours in i was asked ""why are you slowing down"". Actually felt relieved when i was sacked. Overall a terrible job."

Started doing 30 + hours per week with 3 people on the shift, now expected to do the same amount of work but in 18 - 20 hours per week, and with only 2 people on the shift instead of 3. No pay rise or incentive to do extra work expected.
I arrive at 10pm for the night shift, and will be told my finish time when I arrive, which will be anything from 4am - 8am.
Was told during induction that nightshifts are blocked together to help the nightshift have more regular sleep patterns. Hardly ever happens. Everytime a worker leaves theyll be hundreds of applicants willing to take their place, Aldi know this and exploit it to the max. They keep prices low by screwing over their work force. You must be clean shaven for every shift, no designer stubble at all. And you are told you cannot say anything negative about Aldi on the internet or social media, this a an instant sackable offence. Stock assistants are not entitled to sick pay because theyre classed as a business perk."

There are 6 main jobs :- BREAD, PRODUCE, CHILLED, FROZEN, AMBIENT- regular stock, TILL. 
You will be given your duties & a time target. If you hit your time you will not get a well done or pat on the back unless you are new. If you don't hit your time targets you will be told & told & told until you start to get disciplinary actions. Very occasionally you will be retrained. YOU GO TO WORK TO WORK. Talking to each other is frowned upon and you will get told to stop talking if you are seen talking. So NO FUN FOR YOU!! 
You get very poor breaks & will be spoken to like dog dirt but if you can ignore it you might survive this harsh environment. 
Your rota will be all over the place so don't book anything or think that you will see weekends ever again! Unless you know the law you will not get what you want and if you do know working law don't think it will help you.

If you want to give your life up then you can earn a lot by progressing to assistant manager or store manager.","Worked here for 5 years. They pay you a good hourly rate, however this is controlled by the amount of hours they let you work. When prod is tight they will cut your hours from 40 to 25 which is a massive drop in pay. Yet they will give you all the hours as and only when the managers want. Days can start at 4am or finish at midnight, flexibility is a massive thing. They change your rota at the last minute. 
It's very clicky, staff who are liked by management ""friends"" will get the better hours, shifts and jobs. If your not liked as much as the next person, you'll just get stuck on a till for 10 hours with only 2 fifteen min breaks. The old staff tend to push new staff aside and are hardly given a chance to prove themselves. You're constantly being ""performance"" monitored via cctv and test trollies. Deputy Management tend to be young people with very limited experience, they got promoted as they were liked by the store manager, regardless as to weather they are up for to job. They also have big power kicks and look down on store assistants. They will pass jobs on to you simply because they can't be arsed, regardless of what other jobs you're doing, they have the time to do the job but they'd prefer not to.
There is no communication between management. The clicky groups gang up on certain member of staff, a lot of nasty things get said behind staffs back.

It is understandable that the company does not want to spend time training someone for a promotion if in the end they will take a desired job else where if offered.  From the employee point of view, there is no incentive to work hard because you are made to feel unappreciated and blatantly told that you will have no future with the company unless you fully commit to it as a career.  Some employees have kept their aspirations and target dreams job a secret, in the hopes of being promoted (for the wage increase) so that they can sooner save up and leave Aldi. 

There is a culture of bullying among all levels within the store and this is common nation wide.  Troubled managers are simply transferred to other stores rather than being dismissed from the role or demoted.  These troubled managers face no threat of punishment for their behaviour, thus they continue treating staff badly because they know that they will get away with it.  

Food storage standards are pretty low within some branches.  Some stores have small warehouses but receive large deliveries of chilled and frozen products.  What can't be stored in fridges and freezers is left to float around the warehouse for up to 12 hours, reaching room temperatures or actually becoming warm if left near air conditioning units.  These pallets of chilled products do finally make it to the appropriate storage, but not before reaching dramatic changes in temperature.  

The recent Channel 4's Dispatches episode was only presenting the tip of the ice berg when it came to staff moral and low levels of health and safety.  One example of unnecessary pressure is that til staff must scan over 1000 items per hour or face a disciplinary.  If a customer is physically slow, elderly or disabled, no exceptions are to be given, you still must scan as fast as possible and it is up to the customer to keep up with your pace!    
Staff who stack the shelves have strict times to keep to when working each pallet.  There is no time to fetch a ladder or carry it around the store.  You are encouraged to climb shelving, while balancing heavy boxes in one hand.  Whatever the customer doesn't see, doesn't happen in other words.  
 
Aldi employ a lot managers who have left other supermarkets, after talking to them it would appear the cons listed above are common across the board."

Unlike other supermarkets you also have to do the picklist which isnt in alphabetical order, its all random.

This ultimately will be what causes you stress, Aldi's targets, if you're on tills it's about items scanned.

Some days I go into the warehouse and see the stock and just know I'm getting a ""written conversation"" this company doesn't care about your circumstances nor you. 

Aldi absolutely uses intimidation in order to push their employees to work faster, for example, if you weren't fast enough expect a disciplinary. They will keep warning you ways of getting a disciplinary to scare you into working more efficiently. They use fear because they know most their staff won't be able to find another job easily and they can replace you quickly.

Aldi also believes that 4am is sociable hours. If you're doing a night shift then only 4 of your hours will be night pay. 

It is very likely that you will have to work an entire part of the supermarket on your own. 

Don't expect a career here.

I understand if you're job hunting this seems like a good choice but believe me just move on. I already made that mistake."
ALDI,5/2/2016, Assistant Store Manager,Current Employee,"London, England, England",4,,,,,,,o,o,v,Good company to work for,"Look after employees
People are a priority
Promotion prospects are good
Salary","Can be monotonous
Physically demanding
Long hours"
ALDI,14/2/2016, Assistant Store Manager,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","Manchester, England, England",1,1,1,,3,1,1,x,x,x,Worst time of my life - avoid at all costs,Nothing other than the pay - not that you get to spend your money as you're always at work,"Where do I start? I was looking for a change in career and after a lot of research, thought and analysing I decided to apply for Aldi as they appear to be a great company to work for. I applied for assistant store manager and was surprised at how lengthy the whole process was - I saw that as a positive, thinking the company invest a lot into their staff. Nope, that was completely wrong. 

I left my already good job to go onto Aldi (which I thought would be a great move for me). From day one I realised it was the biggest mistake of my life. Firstly the hours are a joke - as an assistant store manager you're expected to work a MINIMUM if 48 hours and then everything else on top. Aldi will tell you over and over again at interview, in their books, in their manuals that you get all this time back - IT IS COMPLETE RUBBISH, DO NOT BELIEVE IT. You also get a day off: if you class your day off as sandwiched between finishing at 11pm the night before and starting at 4am the day after. I came from a job where I worked 12 hour shifts and worked hard - I am NOT afraid of hard work, however Aldi is a complete joke. There is no way (unless you're Superman) you can get everything done. Oh and on your day off, you're expected to trek all the way to the store to hand over the safe key, which takes over 2 hours in total - which you're not paid for. This happens at all of the stores, so just bare that in mind if you actually have a life outside of work. 

Also the bullying culture is horrendous, you are told as a manager to micro manage all of the store assistants and watch them on CCTV constantly to try catch them out. The store manager left me on my own to close up the store after I'd been there for less than a week, then the next day decided to watch my every move on CCTV in fast forward and show me where he felt I went wrong. It was awful - constantly criticised for everything. Whatever you do it isn't good enough. The poor store assistants are given impossible tasks to do just so they fail, this is meant to be some kind of character building exercise but I fail to see how it builds anyone's character other into wanting them to leave. 

I left without a second glance - I'd rather sweep the streets in a snowstorm wearing nothing than work for Aldi. It was the worst experience of my life and even if you want to raise a complaint on how you're treated, they won't let you. Hence why they can say their staff are so happy - they literally will NOT let you complain about anyone senior. 

Area managers are a joke and are all straight out of uni, have no social skills and talk to other human beings like dirt. 

So, if like me, you were looking for a change of career - keep scrolling. Aldi will run you. Don't do it."
ALDI,14/2/2016, Store Assistant,"Former Employee, more than 10 years","Darlington, North East England, England, England",1,1,1,,1,1,1,x,x,x,Bullies and liars running the store,"Handing my notice in and that's about it, even the high pay rate is not worth it at all","Managers are bullies. Managers are liars. No free time or weekends. Shifts ochestrated so you can't do anything in your time away. Eleven hour rule only applies when it suits them. Nothing you do is right even if you follow instructions to the letter. The people that are promoted are never the right ones. Hard workers are ignored and the ones that suck up are the ones promoted. You are threatened with disciplinary if you don't cancel plans on your days off to do extra shifts, don't stay back late or go in early. You have to be 100% flexible for them but they aren't even close to 1% flexible for you by not giving you time off you request months in advance. You have to live, breathe, eat, sleep and talk Aldi 24/7. Your private live is secondary to them and it does not matter what is going on Aldi have to come first, second, third, fourth and fifth. Everything that goes on outside Aldi is a privilege and you should thank Aldi for it because they have the attitude that they make everything good in your life! It couldn't be more wrong! They drag you down, they belittle you, they lie to you, they lie about you, they take away all your self worth and they make it so you are scared to ring in sick then chastise you for going to work sick, they make it so you are frightened to ask for time off because as previously stated your life revolves around Aldi and nothing else once you start working there. You can't ask for help as you get threatened with disciplinaries for not being able to do your job even tho you are asking for the help to be able to do that job."

This helps to make the job easier and you can make some friends along the way.

Challenging, rewarding work - The workloads aren't for those who don't enjoy physically challenging work. However, if you achieve the often difficult targets, it is rewarding to do so, and you often find yourself going home knowing you've done a good days work.

Management - The management in store are down to earth and often understand you, and want you to progress. They set you long and short term targets, and often give and request feedback on how you are doing at work, which helps to set realistic long term goals.","Shifts - Shifts often change at the drop of a penny and you are expected to adjust to any changes made, even if you planned otherwise prior to this. 5am starts for days on end can also become tedious. however, once you finish, the rest of the day is yours!

Targets - Even though Aldi is known for its difficult pallet time targets, it is often shocking to see how quickly you are expected to get stock onto the shelves, even if you are understaffed on some days. If one member of staff is missing due to illness, you are expected to make up for their times, and still hit pallet times without the extra hands."

ALDI,17/3/2016, Duty Assistant,Former Employee,"Southampton, England, England",3,3,3,,3,4,5,v,r,v,Working at ALDI,Aldi is a good company to work for if you are make it to assistant manager level. The pay package is great.,If you are a low level worker it is exhausting . You have to do a two man job for the extra penny you earned on top those that work in ASDA. it can also be discriminatory if you are eastern European or black. I felt that in the two stores I worked at.
ALDI,18/3/2016, Store Assistant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Manchester, England, England",1,1,1,,1,1,1,x,o,r,Store Assistant,"To be bluntly honest the only pro, for a Store Assistant, is the friends you make with the other Store Assistants, Because you're all in it together. I met my best friend at Aldi, so for that I'm truly grateful.","Yeah the salary seems fabulous but if you track your hours correctly you'll find you're not being paid right. Basically the Um and Ah for the complaint period (7 days) so you never get it rectified. 
The benefits package??? Don't make me laugh. It's totally useless. Even if it was useful, you'd not get the chance to use it as your entire life is Aldi. The shift patterns are extremely undesirable. When doing the rotas they seem not to consider whether or not you need to sleep and eat. 
Wake up feeling ill??? Don't even think of ringing in as not even death is an excuse as to why you can't make it in to your shift. If you're lucky not to get screamed at for ringing in and you get say three days off sick, don't imagine it'll mean you've had three days off sick. They use the Bradford Factor and you end up with a crazy score at the end. I had four days off (not in a row) and I scored 16!!! It's a system to stop people taking the you know what. Which, of course, is not fair to people who are genuine. If you look the Bradford Factor up you'll see that it is described as short-sighted and unsuccessful. I'm not surprised Aldi chose that system.
I went to Aldi knowing it would be hard. The work is back breaking and there is no let up. It's like you're expected to be in many places at once while a negative atmosphere swirls around you. Instead of training me properly I have spent almost my entire time there being screamed at. Due to said atmosphere, the team structure constantly breaks apart and the jobs given are done half-assed. I mean who wants to work really hard at 6am with a manager stood over you constantly spewing negativity all over you? So I don't blame them but sorting their mistakes always seems to get me in trouble!!
Each manager has their own way of working the shop floor. Sometimes it leaves my head spinning as I just don't know how to do anything without upsetting at least two managers. You have to keep changing the way you do things. That being said, if you're a ""favourite"" you can pretty much do as you please. 
When I say ""favourite"" I am of course referring to the Store Managers ""Click"". If you're not in that click, woe betide you. The you know what will be flung in your direction.
Managers get in trouble for not being negative enough. I even have an idea that they are not allowed to be positive. Anyone that threatens the balance of this 1950s structure is out. Transferred without being asked. So do I want to be promoted? No. 
The money is just not worth it for any level. 
When it comes to your health, sometimes they can be sympathetic, that is until they realise it will mess with their productivity. Work place accident? About six months in I had a serious accident that involved me going to the hospital. On returning to the store I was told I might face disciplinary action. They really don't care about your well being.
Before anyone who reads this review and judges me as a disgruntled employee, I'd like to say I'm not. I am actively seeking employment elsewhere. I am resigned to my current fate. I just want people to know what it is actually like."

No breaks really you just eat when you can and crack on! When it is busy all the staff are on the tills leaving the shop floor to look like a pigsty and then you are forever playing catchup!

Some directors only have frequent contact with certain team members due to certain projects which means they don't spend enough time with the rest of you to understand more about the type of person you are.
- In Aldi's IT, industry standard practices, whether it be Agile project teams or concepts of the way a developer operates in a standard setup, are not followed and it feels disjointed.
- Career progression between the standard level most are employed at and management level is very difficult as the intermediate stages are viewed as project manager/senior business analyst type roles and are not suited to more technical roles.
- Pay starts below industry average for most experience levels for a standard role, therefore may be better suited to those with little experience or performing a career change.

Be warned it may look like an appealing job but your better off being a janitor. The work they expect is ridiculous, after training I was told by the manager I am working too slow, I explained I had just finished training but that wasn't good enough. Managers would have a laugh with each other but when I store assitant talks, even for a minute the manager would be on your case saying get back to it.

So Aldi bully store managers and then it trickles down to store & stock assistants. I worked at AlDI for over 12 months after leaving the HM forces and believe today this day that I was treated unfair and disrepeacted and bullied. I got spat at my a duty manager and pushed into a mirror but nothing was done about it. It was my word against his so there was no trust and no loyality and integrity at AlDI. Yet they expect us to have all those things but when they dont okay by the rules they expect us too. I would highly reccomend that if you are looking to apply at AlDI prepare to go through alot of mental and physical challenges and never believe what the managers say they just like to squeeze every bit of energy from you and then let you quit and then Aldi can hire somone else. That's Aldi's game plan.

""Mentorship"" is great if you get the right mentor. In my case there was no common ground. I was paired with an area manager who was boastful about working 21 days without a day off and seemed incapable of having a non-Aldi conversation. I appreciate shop talk at work is important, but on a 3 hour drive there should be at least a hint of other interests.

Honestly, 40k and an Audi sounds great, but you will end up forgoing some pretty valuable years of post graduation life. You've waited 3 or 4 years to finally get a salary and ditch the student digs. Don't waste it by shooting for a high salary and missing out on a life. You'll end up a pasty, overworked, underweight and frankly very boring individual.

P.S you friends will think you are boring if you take this job - it's a unavoidable side effect - selling cabbages is not interesting.

I now work in Tech, Make more money and have regular working hours that mean I can enjoy a work life balance. If you're passionate about retail and not much else then go for the AM grad scheme. If you have any other passion, creativity, outlet you need to be willing to sacrifice it. When I read similar reviews in 2014 I thought.. It can't be that bad. It's honestly not worth it."

As such they can be incredibly demotivating, rude and disrespectful. Personally I was denied funeral leave by my area manager ( a contractual right) based on lack of staff, yet they claim to be all about their people. Occasionally show a good attitude towards work life balance but you’re expected to work a MINIMUM of 48 hours a week with no real upper limit. Some of my colleagues regularly work 60-70 hours a week and many experienced salaried managers have either left or been pushed out due to this. By and large the ones who never say no and sacrifice everything for the business get the promotions and the good will. Genuinely loved it when I started out but there is a culture of fear and punishment from area managers nowadays that does little to motivate its staff.

ALDI,11/8/2018, Store Assistant,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","Birmingham, England, England",2,,1,,1,1,1,x,r,r,Apply at your own peril!,"- Decent hourly wage.
- Great people to work with (dependent on the store you work at)
- Paid break (but there is a downside to that too!)
- Company benefits such as discounts on some places.","Where do I begin:

- The time to unload pallets of new stock is incredibly unrealistic and you are often stopped by customers to help them with their enquiries. 

- If you're working a delivery shift, the delivery is sometimes late meaning you won't get out on time and have to find other work to occupy yourself. Even if you still don't get the delivery finished on time despite it not being your fault that it's late, expect a written conversation.

- Maximum of 30 minutes break, even if you are working a 10 hour shift which is not enough in my opinion when working in a fast paced environment like Aldi, where one easily become burned out. 

- Some shifts you are stuck on till all day, even up to 10 hours. 

- Shoplifting; the store that I work at has had an increase in shoplifting. There are no security guards employed to protect staff and customers from people who will harm you if you dare to get in their way. 

- Be expected to work like a robot!  

- The work life balance is terrible and barely given any thought; my social life has suffered because a lot of my time is taken up by working! 

- High staff turnover. 

- Never enough staff around to get the job done; if the store is really busy, most of the staff in store will be busy working away on tills. Which means you sometimes might end up collecting all of the empty cardboard boxes off the shelves after the store is closed, so in other words don't expect to finish your shift on time!

- Sometimes asked to come into work on days off at the drop of a hat.

- Rotas are changed often, meaning that you have to abandon all the plans you have made on your free time to come in to work. 

- Don't expect to get given a party at Christmas.

- No staff discount."
ALDI,28/8/2018, Deputy Manager,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Edinburgh, Scotland, Scotland",1,1,1,,1,1,1,x,x,x,"""Real life Shawshank Redemption""",Only pro is the extra pound an hour,"Theres never enough time to complete tasks and no room for any curve balls. Work scehdule is unbelievable, one week it's 6am starts and the next it's evening starts and this rotates weekly. Work life balance is destroyed, it's bad enough the place is under staff, you're expected to do the work of two. You're having to come into work sleep deprieved aswell, this takes it's toll. Expect wrinkles fast if that's not off putting then also a lower life expectency. 

Management is full of bitter aggressers, bit like the guards in Shawshank. Feel as if the title gives them license to do and say whatever to those without. And that there are superior to those below them and it's stems from the top. But this is odd as it's a job that requires little to no education to enter, hard to understand where the superiority comes from even Area managers simply need a undergrade degree of any discipline to enter. Perhaps it's the lack of knowledge that creates this higher status mentality within management steming from the top. 

Area managers are younglings straight out of Uni with no life experience, this is again to get the most out of them working 60-100 hours weekly, as they don't know any better and have no other commitments at that age. Bit like the stock trading sector in London however the ones Aldi employ tend to be entitled narcissists with type A personalities, that only require a degree in any profession to enter the position and it's as they tend blame their ""training"" for any and all errors and mistreatment of stuff and their own personalities. So they tend to struggle to relate to staff members of any age and also behave in sicklical ways. Much like children, they will engage in wars with individuals whether it be store assistants or managers. This stems from the belief that I have this title so you must see as this way and act this way, my behaviour may resemble that of a 12 year old and I may seem 300 miles away from what an area manager should be but  you must act as if I am warden and address me as such.

The worst of it is nothing can be disputed, their word is law these kids are not watched but left alone with thier magnifying glass. It's deeply demoralizing for the people working around them, recieving constant feedback on trivial matters, passive aggressive tactics and no oppurtunity to explain yourself as anything like that is viewed as back chat and the penality is cold shoulders and a loss in the oppertunity to progress in the company. To top it off there is no way to change this as these kids are the way makers and get away with acting like Jeff Bezos from his early days at Amazon and are more obtuse than the Warden out of Shawshank, the staff have no option but to take it on the chin like a man(because thats how men should be) and quickly lose their mental state for an extra pound over other retailers. There are no possible ways to speak to someone to solve this problem even the area managers themselves can't be reasoned with, you are classed as nothing  but low income earning trash by a Sports Science graduate recovering from his 21st. 

Look for something else unless you are don't want to deal with all that, not an isolated incident happening in many of these stores.  Have worked with company for 4 years been in 9 stores in 4 regions, it's same everywhere. But if you wanna feel anxious at work everyday maybe it's for you, I was gonna call this WORST RETAIL JOB OUT THERE but I think ""Real life Shawshank redemption"" is more fitting, creates a more fitting portrayal of Aldi life."

Like many others I joined with the intention to work my way up to the ‘Aldi dream’ of a company car and travel to the promised land, this is nothing but false hope.... unless you do the graduation scheme straight out of university there is no such thing to work towards. In turn this means the highest rank you can work up to is assistant store manager which would typically take 3-5 years, not bad right? Think again. This role will only ever be offered to you through working like a slave week in week out with utter consistency for the full duration. You will consequently dedicate your life and sacrifice in some cases family and any hobby’s you have to reach this role. Once obtained your life will then be Aldi, Aldi, Aldi, you will be on a salary and work a minimum of 48 hours a week with one day off. Throughout an Aldi career you will also be subject to critical judgement and there will be no praise for doing something great however do something bad/unsatisfactory and you will be shouted at and in some cases punished with a warning. In conclusion a job at Aldi is a life sentence of dedication and sacrifice as you serve a prejudicial hierarchy, I am left asking, how can a job as simple as stacking shelves and serving customers become so glorified and yet behind the scenes resemble slave labour?"

My 'mentor' told me I wouldn't need the postcode of the stores 1hr away and proceeded to drive off down the M1 at 80mph leaving me inevitably lost and stressed, a great way to start! 

Training is non-existent, they'll drop you into a store and expect you to just know how to do things and complete tasks at the same speed as people with years of experience, just madness. 

I was asked by my 'mentor' to reprimand a Store's Assistant Manager with 10+ years experience on my 4th day. Because I did this tentatively (as I think most people would!) I was told 'you've been here for a while, you need to toughen up'. 

Generally work 60+ hours weeks which was expected given the salary. HOWEVER the way the shifts are spread out  (6am or midday starts) means your sleep pattern is ruined. Once did a shop inventory and worked 6am-11pm then back in at 5am to finish at 5 that afternoon. A healthy 29 hours worked with 6 hours between shifts (2 of which driving!)

As other people elude to the other Area Managers are fine, except from the ones who have been there for a few years. One told me with pride how he had worked a 110hr week which gives you some idea of their mindset.

Once had to drive for 6 hours on my day off as a store manager had locked the key in the safe so backwards and forwards from the head office. Led to me falling asleep whilst driving (you need the days off to catch up!) and nearly crashing which ultimately made my decision to leave much easier."

2. ""You can't go home 'til it's finished"". If it takes an extra 6 hours after a 10 hour night shift, tough luck. 

3. ""Your thanks is your paycheck"" never expect a thankyou or well done. That's what is expected of you, because Aldi pays you the extra pound an hour. Anything less is unacceptable.

Management are the worst I’ve ever come across. No empathy, couldn’t care less. 
Workload is mentally and physically unmanageable, impossible timeframes and absolute chaos. 
Customers are the rudest I’ve ever came across.
No work life/home balance. Minimum contracts, higher contracts always promised but nothing ever comes of it. Extra hours are not always available and inconsistent but still expected to work over 60 hours at Christmas. 
Pay has been so misconceived by outside sources. The pay is actually awful, they never pay you right. Always feels like they dock you and leave out hours of pay. You are too exhausted at this point to even care or figure it out though. If you leave, they don’t pay you at all so don’t work notice. Just leave on payday, go work at Tesco for 10p less and without a workload of 5 robots. 
No advancement opportunities, most managers are 15 to 20 years in, in their mid 40s or 50s and the area managers who boss them about are straight out of university 20 year olds. They are clueless and never last even a year. Don’t believe the lies, don’t waste your time. Do not ruin your life. People try to commit suicide on a Monday and get invited to a formal disciplinary hearing on the Tuesday.

No others I can think of","Reviews
1.	Consultations on colleagues performance irregular - affecting conclusions.  Positive service feedback unreported.
2.	Review process done wrong - wrong issues included, ie health, others not, long term goals.  No mutually agreed reports
3.	Vague goals/ negative ‘constructive’ feedback– consistently insufficient detail on performance related to goals, affecting ability to improve.  Management told, just said improve, little training.  Comments - negatives written, positives turned negative/ ignored.  Positive corrections (wrong actions, no positive feedback) considered good review approach. 
4.	Actively used to replace existing staff, knowledge/abilities ignored.
5.	Review meetings irregular/rare – no time to correct behaviours.  Management view final, implication read and sign forms, input unwanted, answering back.  No real discussion.
6.	Management failure to resolve issues – unable to recognise, seek solutions for months, despite told.  Stated unwillingness to train.  Some issues resolved by others, others never.
7.	Email comments by staff – management happy to say situation different if gives their desired impression/ fail to act on them.  No clarification sought.
8.   Judged negatively for failing to do jobs not done at all/ or hardly due to lack of opportunity. 

Training - Multiple requests for external training.
1.	Only in-house - If external desired, own time/self pay.  Research from TV/ online.
2.	Automatic training requirements following reviews - fail to inform staff
3.	Staff training – not recorded or discussed after, any issues wrote refer to training.
4.	No one departmental approach to jobs – all doing differently, one way, one person fine, another wrong.  Seen in multiple tasks.
5.	Admitted inability to teach essential skills – to senior management when judging staff for lacking skills.  Some training only provided by colleagues.
6.	Training – hands on avoided, verbal short, then go, no written departmental targets.
7.	Reluctant to invest in training/MBTI/Learning style assessments – time away from work

Unsupportive management
1.	Outgoing management kept quiet – officially following viewpoint required by those staying, quietly saying they were helping, they and others say staff doing well, substantially improving, rarely officially raised or recorded. 
2.	Job description changes, staff unaware - Management unconcerned, despite having judged staff on unknown changes.  No investigations/apologies.

DISABILITY HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT/ MANAGEMENT
Even supported management made little effort to communicate with staff different from them.
1.	Rigid Official Review performance targets - naturally biased against many disabilities, don’t recognise strengths due to communication styles. 
2.	Disabilities - unable to understand effects of Autism/similar conditions.  Judgement on ability to do work based on assumptions.

Attitude changes - no safety issue, no preventative action
1.	Sharp, ANGRY management corrections – apology given, say will positively correct if see others doing same thing, in same way as just been corrected.  Suddenly no issue.  
2.	Correction for actions - displaying flexibility due to others action’s.  Manager enters, no questions, one person blamed, another takes blame.  Suddenly no issue, manager sharply says do properly, leaves. 
3.	Wrong correction by official trainer – they apologised, issue not raised in recent training.

Good relations management relations not encouraged – unapproachable, untrustworthy
1.	Negative service comments from customers – not acted on
2.	Negative comments when systems introduced – at times avoiding potentially life threatening/ unpleasant reactions, following training.  Told to stop, time wasting.
3.	Angry/sharp/aggressive management style - if not get desired responses, or when help sought.  Reasons not sought.  Experienced by many.
4.	Consistency sought by Managers – managers routinely inconsistent - opposing approaches.  Desired approach changes, staff not told in timely manner.
5.	Incorrect/negative information given by management - to staff concerning others, affecting departmental relations, corrected by team members.  No comment on improvements. 
6.	Unknown issues - Staff considered failing for not providing solutions, these not sought once told, negative written comments.

Poor Management – Higher management aware of issues.  No attempts to clarify.
1.	Unable to calculate increasing workload - reduced staff, at full stretch, told to cope. 
2.	Output more important than health – health issues causing time off/affecting work considered valid negative review issues.  Management concern - staff stressed, not reasons.
3.	In-house medicals, flu jabs etc – managers don’t tell you, attend in own time.
4.	Approved holidays not recorded - multiple overlaps, short staffing, stress.  Consultation avoided further clashes.  Staff falsely blamed for not following procedures.
5.	Rarely recorded contributions – not pass on changes in contribution requirements in timely manner, contributions not recognised.
6.	Communication poor/non-existent - targets, meetings, procedures etc.  Negative feedback, different systems, inability to prepare for meetings, stakeholders not told of changes.
7.	Communication flexibility not required – If initial approach fails, other person blamed.
8.	‘Discussions’/ Mentoring’ one way - from manager.  Only very precise phrases acceptable.
9.	Poor Staffing/ work/ life balance – Staffing levels insufficient, temporary staff avoided.  Stressed staff told to cope. Overtime essential (pressured to) in quiet times.
10.	Solutions – Only management ways wanted, others discouraged, including previous good systems.  Ideas led to accusations of inability to cope, and blaming staff for failing.
11.	Management felt unable to listen by staff due to confidence loss – therefore did not raise issues/give explanations, denied it was their problem. 

New management lacking essential knowledge
1.	Failed to know staff - assumed abilities/learning styles - wasted time ‘teaching’ unnecessarily.  Staff (perm & Temp) leaving, with useful information. 
1.	Tried to hide mistakes - even when made aware.  Resolved by speaking to higher management.  Multiple mistakes.
2.	Management told something possibly not know – regular, sharp responses.
3.	Claimed issues not raised with them when they had – they had dismissed issue.
4.	Removed systems preventing issues - commented when re-occurred, solutions not sought.

Favouritism
1.	Staff made official first aiders, receiving full external training before probationary interview.
2.	Some temporary staff retained once not needed, most go immediately. 
3.	Some if they hate a task, removed from it.  Others must do as allocated.
4.	3 month probationary reviews – Most done after 4 months, favourites promptly, noted.

The store that I work in has a more autocratic leadership style, meaning that nearly all levels of management pass down jobs which need to be carried out, although I am aware that this is what managers are expected to do, there is no motivational aspects to their leadership. Employees are constantly watched by management who seem completely unaware of how hard each employee works. There is almost no organisation within the store that I work, holiday forms are given back up to a month late and no explanation as to why the holiday has been declined. Whilst on my probation I was given one 5 minute review when I was meant to have one per week. The night managers are constantly swearing at each other or employees (who swear back, i would as well) I know the job must be stressful but there is more to being a manager than passing down jobs which need to be completed, a little guidance would be nice."

Despite their ""Always help the Customer"" attitude they teach you, if you get swamped with customer requests you're branded as a slacker for not getting your own tasks done.

It's a no-win situation from the moment you put on that godforsaken green uniform till you take it off in anger and insert it into the nearest available manager.."

This is bad considering many of the staff are on a low income, jobs have been lost and its a clear gimmick to help boost sales as staff will have no option but to purchase food from the shop floor.

But those are just minor niggles to me, the problem at the moment is the management restructuring. There has been virtually zero communication with the colleagues about it and moral is generally low as a result since obviously a lot of the managers are well liked and are being moved, stepping down etc. Lastly, the daily huddles are never communicated with the colleagues and are just written down in our canteen to read and just seem so condescending and come across as it's the colleagues fault when the company are overspent on wages and has nothing to do with the management's, mismanagement."

When leaving University I also was able to pick up hours and move to cash office instead of checkouts.","As said in the title the job does get tedious especially on checkouts, but that is to be expected consdering it is quite a repetitive job. Also there was alot of times when we were without a superviser and left to work on our own. Also within supermarkets colleagues are expected to have knowledge in all areas of the store and have to deal with problems themselves.

Discount is OK, double discount days before Christmas.  Staff all tend to be in the same boat, so everyone tends to get along.","The hands-off approach I mentioned?  Thats because all the managers are sat in the canteen drinking coffee and sucking up to the store manager whilst you're grafting.  When they *do* grace you with their presence they tend to be rude, abrasive and/or completely incompetant.  I've been threatened numerous times by managers for such heinous crimes as wanting to finish on time, asking for my breaks and asking for money to keep tills stocked several hours after I made the initial request - oh, and refusing to sell out of date stock.

I applied for a free apprenticeship and was denied, upon learning that I had applied to go to college - something I couldn't do if I was already enrolled on an apprenticeship scheme - I was miraculously granted my inital request to be on the apprenticeship.

When I complained about management victimisation there was an investigation launched.  The investigation comprised of asking the manager in question if he had bullied me, then telling me I had made it all up.
Almost every member of my department had backed me up and told me to complain that I was being victimised, and almost every single one of them would have provided evidence if asked."

I started there when I was 17, at this point I had just started my A Levels and it was great as it was really flexible hours, which fit around my studying. Decent pay for doing an easy job. Worked with some great people, had a laugh which made shifts go quicker. I worked on George but it would have been easy to get overtime on other departments.","A new store manager started and then things started to go downhill. He would wander about on his mobile phone when things needed to be done, and just moaned about them instead of doing anything to help. It got worse when he thought it was acceptable to talk to me like I wasn't capable of doing a job I had been doing for 2 years (which I had won awards for doing a good job), and so I spoke to him exactly the same, which I got pulled into the office for. After that he constantly harassed me at work, pretty much watched everything that I did and got other managers to spy on me (how professional). Got pulled into the office after this for a number of times, one which included being pulled in by a different manager for having 'purple hair' when it was simply platinum blonde/grey, which the people manager even came in and said 'what is he going on about purple hair?' and walked back out again. It got to a point where I could not even be bothered with the hassle any more, and so when I got another job (in which it is actually acceptable to express your opinion) I didn't think twice about leaving. I guess it is luck of the draw which managers you end up with but in my experience the managers have their favourites, yet the company as a whole boasts about diversity meaning that there is less bullying and harassment. If you want a job in which people will listen to your ideas and opinions, do not apply here!!"

The crux though is that every section leader knows they have very little chance of developing into managers within the next few years due to the restructure, 7 in 10 want to leave because they feel abandoned by the company.  Section Leader was only supposed to be a little step, short term to being a manager for those who want it.  It is the only justification for working long hard hours, little pay and little credentials for it. Its now been made almost permanent for some people.  Whomever is reading this can negotiate a pay, we can't, therefore without a decent pay rise, without development, why work for Asda as a section leader?

They can and will stab you in the back if it can benefit them in some shape or form. They never have a view of the bigger picture and generally are not properly trained to be in a higher role. 

Managers and section leaders potentially lack the ability to lead, inspire and promote a healthy working environment and instead opt for bullying tactics, guilt tripping and backstabbing just to get work done. Even then, the work load increases and yet the time to do so decreases. If you work too fast, you are accused of cutting corners, if you work too slow you are told off for not working to the best of your ability. ... Huh?

Being guilt tripped and potentially black mailed into working extra shifts.

If you are not part of the 'inner circle' or so to speak, prepare to be moaned out if you so much as have a chat with someone for less than ten seconds, yet you will see the managers and their lackies wasting time in the warehouse for minutes on end. 

Terrible pay for the work you do; it is far more stressful than they would have you believe, and the ideals of working as a team is garbage. You either suck up to your 'superiors' or you will not have a good time.

They thought it would be best for me and it was, meaning that I had a good work-life and education balance.

The job can be very varied and also is quite entertaining, it is also nice to be appreciated by some of the customers for a good job.","The biggest problems I see from working at Asda all relate to the short termist view of managers and head office. For example they will make decisions based only on the here and now, without considering the potential impact of the decisions, that often leads to bigger issues, which they then pass the blame on to other people.
Another problem is the way that some managers will promise things like help or progression and then conveniently find ways to avoid their promises, which causes many staff to be demotivated.
There is also a distinct lack of progression despite what was advertised when I started. It also seems to be based on who you like and how long you have been at asda rather than your abilities and management capability.
There is also a distinct lack of appreciation for good work, new ideas or use of initiative as well as an expectation that you are always available.
There are also problems with visits from other managers as the store panics and ends up stressing everyone out to get things perfect (which they should be anyway). 
They managers and business also seem to ignore the company values such as respect for the individual and always having integrity. 
The final issue is that most staff are usually overstretched which leads to more sick days and even more overstreched staff.

However a lot of the problems stem from three areas, one is that the night staff seem to get away with doing far less work than the day team. Two the managers are unwilling to solve issues due to the coflicts they would have to resolve with the night team and also head office. The third restraint is head office who seem to have unrealistic expetations and don't like hearing the truth it seems."

then, to make matters worse, asda has a ""fair policy"" on management and supervisory positions, where people who have worked for a long time get the opportunity, but instead they gave it to a power crazed, sadistic lunatic who's only goal was to make people miserable, because his life was miserable, who had only been there a couple of weeks! 

then there was the staffing issue, i was contracted to work 6-11, then i took on night shift overtime, commonly working 12 hour night shifts, however, during my contracted hours, i noticed that soon people began to leave, they weren't being replaced, so then there were around 7 employees, working 32 aisles of rather large palettes which are meant for a minimum of 12-15 people, and then expected to finish by 9 o'clock in order to cut down paying hours, it was ridiculous, we were practically forced to leave early on some nights, as there was ""nothing to do""."

The sharesave scheme is also fairly okay although complicated and confusing.,"The first challenge is getting past the disorganisation, perpetuated by the bad management. Managers do not seem to work hard at all, instead preferring to sit in the cafe and delegate tasks. Cuts have wracked the shop, leaving areas under-staffed and inefficient. Nepotism and favoritism is rife - hard working colleagues are completely overlooked for promotion in favour of colleagues to prefer to gossip and make friends with the managers. Managers themselves are condescending and disrespectful. The working environment is poor. Working your way upwards if you have been put on a certain section of the store, for example porting, is essentially impossible, leading many people to leave after a while. Paperwork is almost never done, and you will be frequently berated for not turning up to shifts you were never told you were working. Shifts are too long, resulting in boredom."

- Some training is irrelevant, for my discount card i had to do an online test about disabled parking? and other topics that weren't related to my department in the slightest
- Thrown in at the deep end, you are expected to know everything from day one, includes knowing were all items are and a 20min training session on tills (Believe me customers will make your life hell)
- A lot of managers seem to have 'Big man' syndrome and seem to think because they have a tiny bit of power that they are some kind of god

Another issue I have is that the office staff leave quite early on in the day so if you work mostly evenings like myself it is difficult to get in touch with them for things such as new uniform, or in my fellow colleagues case, arranging things for her pregnancy such as clothing, as hers no longer fits her."

Things on the nightshift have got worse by the day over the last year especially. There is staff leaving all the time and they don't get replaced. The extra slack is obviously picked up by the remaining staff. The company are squeezing us to the point everyone feels like giving up. The moral has gone so low that after being around everyone after only an hour of starting work you feel the need to run for miles. The company honestly doesn't care about the nightshift in the slightest. They also closed the canteen down for us (but not on days) which is a massive blow for many of us who loved a hot meal to help get through the shift, especially when we have more work to do than our skeleton staff can cope with. Not had a one to one or anything of the like in over 4 years. The pay was fine in my opinion but as things have got so bad now I feel the money isn't even close to being worth it. Can't really bring myself to do overtime anymore as I'm just too tired. When my days off come round it's really hard to switch to get Into day mode in order to see daylight, family/friends, get to places before they close like banks, hairdressers etc. really isn't an easy way of living life so when you're only getting paid so much and things have gotten so bad it's just not worth it anymore. I'll admit I'm having a rant here but don't be mistaken in thinking I'm alone in feeling like this, as it truly is mirrored in every colleague in my store on nights. I'd happily go on and on but as always...I'm too tired and can't be bothered. It's not like someone high up is going to read this and think things need to be improved. They'll just think I'm an ungrateful colleague who should be thankful I have a job. Maybe that's true but as I said I used to be happy over the years but now I'm far from it. So yeah it's gone st."

Keeps you Fit
Most of the staff are friendly.","1 Under paid and overworked due to being understaffed.
2 Ruthlessly Austere, they sack managers and employ colleagues as Section leaders, on a fraction of the wage.
3 They mislead customers with ""rollback"" offers. The company does not mention that they put the price up on the product a week before.
4 Very little communication between anyone.
5 Poor Professionalism. People applying for jobs and finding out they were unsuccessful when someone starts the job they applied for. Section leaders finding out someone else, in the store, is in line for their job before they have been told to step down.
6 The companies values and the charity work are not genuine. Its just to try and create a good public image. Basically a PR ploy.
7 Staff are on minimum contracts, yet are often encouraged to do overtime. This is so the company can save money on holiday pay.
8 Working Christmas eve or New years day is usually time and a half. A terrible rate.
9 Most colleagues over 40 have physical disabilities to varying degrees. This is due to the nature of the work and the speed required to carry out the tasks.
10 Promotion usually means you get a full time job, but spend most of that time still filling shelves. The only difference is you get a small pay rise, and you are expected to cover holidays and sickness. Basically, they have you over a barrel."
ASDA,30/12/2014, Checkout Colleague,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","London, England, England",2,4,2,,3,4,1,x,r,r,Making the best of my decision to work here,"- I have met many friendly colleagues who work in similar roles that I do, who are genuinely nice and helpful. Some of them are still optimistic and perhaps more thick skinned than I am. They do an amazing job, are still pleasant to talk to and are optimistic and ethical, hard working. I applied for Asda because the employees seem happy, so I presumed they are treated well as employees. Now I know that it's part of their personality. Not situational.
- After 3 months of working here, I got my discount card which is appreciated
- Benefits
- I haven't been asked to do too much overtime, but that's because I mentioned to them my health issues at interview as well as had a telephone session with occupational health as I realised I would need to look out for myself
- Sometimes, management can be professional and compassionate, but it really depends on how the person is, has nothing to do with any leadership training or understanding that people need to be treated with respect
- I'm earning money after being out of work for a year
- I work part time so have days to recuperate 
- Interview was friendly, if a bit non representative of real working environment
- Windows in the store. Huge ones. They allow us to get real sunlight. One of the main reasons I chose this role over John Lewis.
- Learning curve for me about work in retail - how to discern between truth and embellishment, and about lowering expectations.","- Checkout colleagues have no idea what's going on since they are not allowed to join the company huddles (meetings) when they occur. In fact, I had gone into work early one day and joined one and the store manager was UNHAPPY and mentioned it was strange to see a checkout colleague at a huddle!
- Company values about respect for individual do not seem to be reflected in the way I have personally fund management to behave
- Management is stressed and overworked, which has been taken down to section leaders. They always seem so stressed and overworked... and then it goes onto the shopfloor staff. I hold compassion for them, yet surely effective leadership training (LDPs) would benefit all.
- Ineffective to no communication
- We are just numbers... I try my best to not allow it to get to me, but I don't feel valued
- Variable moods of customers and management. I feel that there have been times I have been talked down to by management, and its unfair as I am reasonably sane and intelligent
- We haven't got proper chairs on checkout, and it will affect our spines and health. I choose to stand because it feels less dangerous than sitting on broken chairs.
- Very minimal and poor training, expected to learn on the job. Only one day of watching training videos. Which is true, yet it affects service in store. I had a customer shout at me for not knowing my job. She was right. I didn't have training to help her in that instance.
- A lot of things are not on the system, customers constantly ask me to check if something is on special offer as advertised, because they are so used to having something being advertised on offer, but not on offer at the till
- We don't have fridge freezers on the till, so A LOT of meat and other food goes as waste. I feel sad that customers do not value food at all, or choose to put it back themselves if they change their mind and that we are under-staffed so the runners cannot always be putting back food.
- I filled in a survey regarding my opinions around a month or so ago. Was an opportunity t speak up, but as it was towards the end of my shift and I didn't have time to plan my responses, perhaps not entirely representative of my views. 
- The term ""overspending on wages"". Understaffing affects service and the holistic health of those colleagues who are encouraged, persuaded or choose to take overtime. Loads of it. 
-Customers come first, then the company, then management... which doesn't seem to tie in with an egalitarian view I held.
- This might just be particular to my store, but it seems that management are not too concerned with the sometimes less than professional attitude of certain colleagues, even when it's flagged up. I get a few colleagues who make me feeel uncomfortable working there, so I have forced myself to ignore them when I am genuinely a friendly person.
- It seems my store is not the only one with similar issues, which is why I finally chose to write this review
- I do not feel happy or valued here, and therefore due to situational reasons will not be able to continue for very long, as my mental health is beginning to suffer due to stress and disappointment. Being forced to resign is a con in any workplace. Welcome to the real world, I guess"
ASDA,1/1/2015, Section Leader,Former Employee,"Aberdeen, Scotland, Scotland",3,3,5,,1,4,3,v,r,v,"Great place to be a colleague, tough life if you want to progress","Great benefits. A lot of folks have been with asda a long time so there's a strong sense of belonging. As a colleague you are well looked after with plenty of options available to you for shift swaps, 'me time' (unpaid days off). In my store there's always plenty of overtime available and I believe this is the same for most stores. 

I would recommend working here as a colleague.","Recent restructure of management has seen the opportunities to progress beyond Section Leader diminish. It is however far easier to become a Section Leader and due to the need to fill all positions in the last 6 months, there has been an influx of inexperienced people stepping up (think straight out of school and never had a job, let alone worked in retail) leading to increased pressure on those of us who are experienced, as we have to keep them above water as well as doing our own job.

When area managers come to visit there is a mad rush to get the shop looking its best, quite often with managers/section leaders putting in extra hours to bring up the standards. In my opinion, senior management should see how our stores look on a typical day, with the budgets and resources we have.

There has been a recruitment crisis in the Aberdeen area recently, mainly due to the fact that you can get an entry level position in an oil industry office and get paid more than in a supermarket. Again this has led to the employment of many who otherwise wouldn't get through group selection, simply because they are an extra pair of hands."

Leadership/management. Just not the right people in charge.
They employ and promote family members foremost. Almost everyone in an asda store is related to someone. So there's people not getting jobs after a perfect interview and people getting jobs that have no work ethic.
Rotas are done the day before the new week and you're expected to adhere to this.
No career progression. They have restructured management letting go 50% of department managers across all stores and hiring a lot more team leaders to work crazy hours for hardly anything more than an average colleague. They promoted people to these roles through favouritism and the easier ones to mould or manipulate (with no chance of progression you wouldn't work 50+hours a week for 70p more, nobody would).
They expect you to work to the point you are sweating and pay you buttons for it.
They don't allow you study leave like they used to or career breaks.
They monitor a lot on camera now. Don't know if they have been asked to do this. 
Management cover for one another.
They monitor your breaks when they have no reason to then take excessive breaks and extra breaks.
I've seen good colleagues who are hard working being squeezed out the door. 
The values of the company that were presented to me when I initially started are completely non-existent.
As they have cut back you are forced to do jobs you weren't hired to do. If you don't comply you are presented with an ultimatum. 
They used to give you incentive to carry out your job to a high standard with gift vouchers etc. however they have stopped this. 
You get 10% discount which isn't great and a double discount day however on double discount day there is less discounted items than any other time of the year.

The company have made changes to staff on a mass scale, in a short period of time - which should have never been done internally. The speed in which the changes have taken place has been the main issue. The main reason asda has done well is it's relationship with the customers. Colleagues who are unhappy will find it hard to maintain this. You've dug your own grave. This has been since late 2014.

Be under no illusion, you are just a very small cog in a very large (green) machine, and as such, easily dispensed with.

If you're wiling to be a well behaved drone, then you will go far. Be prepared to work in a niche job with no prospect of promotion (unless you fully embrace the ""happy clappy"" world of back-slapping).

Technology is lacking. Everything is second hand from Wal-Mart and it doesn't feel like there's any investment in trying to make colleagues jobs easier. If DVDs and CDs were tagged automatically at the depot then it'd enable MVG colleagues to focus on refill than tagging for hours on end.

No way to search for stock/location, there are 400+ DVDs out in the charts alone - you can't answer customer enquiries efficiently. Location changes on telxons a few days before modular implementation so restocking can become hard.

Your average supermarket bonuses","Along with the pro's some of the senior management can be very rude and very unprofessional. There is no real communication between management and your average colleagues. This is potentially down to some in the higher positions being disassociated from your average colleague. It's understandable that they are subjected to preassures from people in higher positions again but they does not warrent the behavour that i've witnessed for example. 

Before therestructure there was blatant bullying from department management, there would also be preassure on you to work when you've expressly said you won't. Often this would be ignored and you would be informed you are working and that is the end of it. I have personally been bullied by a previous manager, however no one would openly say anything and I did not feel comfortable taking any action because all the management are friendly with one another and openly discuss everything. I felt it would lead to further bullying. 

In the colleague handbook it is fairly stated that you will be required to work flexably within the store and undertake an array of tasks, which is fine to a degree. However, hours get cut and they give out the minimum amount of hours then when things suffer and management come asking questions, as to why departments are half empty or shelves in disaray they are not satisfied with the response that you are short staffed due to lack of hours and refusal to recruit. As seasons become busier it becomes near impossible to complete work handed to you, as you are expected to undertake large amounts of work that ideally require at least 2 or more colleagues. It can be exhausting. 

I'm unsure if this is the same for all stores now but within the store I work, they are expecting everyone to become till trained to queue bust but this leads to you being stationed on a till for around an hour or more of your shift leading to the department you are also expected to work becoming neglected and work not getting completed which leads to unhappy section leaders/managers.

They seem to recruit relations within the store. Nearly everyone is related to one another across departments. So gossip is a widespread, especially from management. Confidentiality is non-existant. Colleague investigations for example get discussed openly within departments. 

The new restructure changed the order, as in you now have; Colleagues, Section leaders(replacing section managers), main managers then, the store general manager and their Sub general manager. They have eliminated the title of a Section Manager but have given all the duties to the Section Leaders for a fraction of the pay. From general chats with my own current Section Leader they are expected to do a lot of work for hardly for very little extra money. 

Training is quite poor. You get your expected on paper training, watch a lot of training videos. Practical training isn't fantastic, not within my department anyway. I was employed as a Baker, yet when my old manager was in charge, I was expected to persue my own training from the other Bakers, which is fair, I have initiative and would ask but would be met with, ask the manager, or sort it with them. Over a year down the line and it has taken that long for me to be allowed to progress with training, I have become quite set that I will never complete Baker ""training"" to earn the Bakers wage. Despite working as one for a year, I do not feel I have been paid fairly for the work I have done. You are required to use the ""guns"" within your job. No training is provided for these though then you're looked at a bit foolishly for not knowing what to do. 

Last but by no means least, it is an extremely thankless job working for ASDA. Equipment also needs serious updates across the stores. Lastly, god forbid you become ill, 12 weeks is all you get, if you're not fit and well by then you can expect to be let go.

ASDA,27/3/2015, Frozen Colleague,"Former Employee, more than 5 years","Rushden, East Midlands, England, England",2,2,2,,1,2,1,x,x,x,Gone down hill fast since the 2014 restructure. My review is based on the Frozen Department.,"I used to love working at Asda and could see myself staying there for some time, but since the 2014 restructure, Asda really has gone down hill fast.

Share save scheme is a good idea with a possible good return on your money.

Benefits like the cycle to work scheme and discounts on days out, attractions, holidays, restaurants etc.

Little bit of an yearly bonus but if you break the bonus down weekly doesn't really mean much as we are on such a poor wage anyway.

Store discount card helps a little.

Really great shop floor colleagues without these guys Asda would really fall to bits, Not sure if store management really value colleagues . . . Its only them that are keeping it going after last years restructure.","Lack of colleagues on day and night shifts, Too much stock that we don't need coming in from Asda depots despite stock issue and P.I. process, Too much work load for colleagues.

Store itself is falling to bits and not fit for purpose, Store is too small for the growth of Home Shopping which has a knock effect to the rest of the store plus store was never built to take the stock levels and money it takes every week. Health and safety issues in store and tight budget to get things fixed, Closed staff canteen to save money.

Relying on the few colleagues to do overtime to keep the store running and the shelves stocked,

Customers becoming aggressive and more ignorant due to products not on shelves because of colleague shortages, There needs to be some basic rules in supermarkets to protect staff and stock in shops i.e. not eating as you walk around, Dumping fresh food, Shop lifting etc. I know they pay the wages but some people really do take the mick.

More pressure on colleagues. If you don't cover holidays you are left with even more to do on your return from your holiday or day off. No colleagues to cover you as there is no one ( or nobody wants to work in frozen )

Not sure if some managers are up to being mangers, Some can't manage there way out of a wet paper bag. Some store management seem distant and aloof.

So many fellow full time colleagues have left my store, People leave but are not replaced or replaced with part time inexperienced students. Also Asda doesn't like full time colleagues anymore . . . they cost too much !

Better pay structure, Asda as a store has so many diverse departments. Some departments have it easy while some departments have it hard in relation to the work they do with no difference in hourly rate and pay.

I know retail is extremely tough at the moment with the supermarket price wars, But the management in Leeds live on another planet and seem intent on destroying Asda. 

The management restructure of 2014 made the better managers redundant and replaced them with less paid  inexperienced section leaders and was supposed to put more colleagues back on the shop floor which has simply not happened.

Some of the section leaders have stepped down in there roles in my store because of work pressures. There is simply to much work to do and not enough people. 

Maybe there is some kind of master plan to all the extreme cut backs Asda are making. All I have seen is customers shopping elsewhere because of empty shelves as a result of colleague cut backs which equals less money being taken at the checkout as products that customers want to buy are not stocked.

So much fresh store waste being thrown away, Again being created by too much stock coming in and not enough colleagues to put the stock on the shelves . . . Its a real shame seeing good food being thrown away because of being out of date. I will never forget Christmas 2014 by the amount of waste being thrown away some of which never even made it onto the shop floor, Just crazy:-(

I think Asda now is all about % and figures. As long as they balance the store books waste, wages overtime, consumables etc to what the store takes in sales every week nobody really care's:-( All smoke and mirrors and robbing Peter to pay Paul:-( and not about the customer.

Met some great colleagues which I will miss, But have now left Asda and looking forward to the future away from retail."
ASDA,31/3/2015, ASDA Colleague,"Current Employee, more than 8 years","Teesport, England, England",1,1,1,,1,1,1,x,r,x,Avoid this Depot ASDA TEESPORT IC,10% Discount card but by the way they go on about it and the risks involved with using it you would think it was 90%. I do believe the ASDA ethos is a brilliant thing but its not adhered to at all at Teesport.,"Untrained, unprofessional, inexperienced and unapproachable Managers. No Leadership No direction. Managers spend far to long in meetings amounting to nothing other then revolving the same pathetic ideas over and over again. Managers are Teflon coated in that nothing ever sticks to them they constantly bully and discriminate against Colleagues but when investigated by another Manager they get away with it to do it again and again. As a Colleague you go through a process of hearings with these uneducated Managers who treat you in a unprofessional and unfair way normally ending in a final warning or termination of your contract. This is normally then told to everyone else as confidentiality does not exist Managers cant wait to tell colleagues what has happened in a investigation . For such a so called ""GREAT"" place to work the turn over of staff within Teesport in its 9+  years of been open is huge this in itself speaks volumes as to what sort of place it is. Health and Safety is a total joke it looks good on a paper but so much is covered up and hidden by dishonest Management and a Health and Safety Manager who is only interested in himself and his own career the colleagues mean nothing to him he has made colleagues afraid to report things because of his unprofessional and unfair handling of so many cases. Advice given or suggestions offered to him are just met with a negative and unprofessional response. I strongly believe that ASDA is a great company to work for and has invested a lot of time and money into making it so. Sadly they don't look into how depots are run they don't vet the calibre or quality of Managers who are suppose to practice and preach the ASDA ""Values"" i can only speak for ASDA Teesport IC i have worked here over 9 years since it opened and watched something that started so brilliantly become the awful place of work it is now."

Lack of training on checkouts, as I'm a queue buster I'm often left to figure out how to handle situations myself and kind of figure out things as I go along, I've been working in asda for 8 months and queue bust frequently and have only just figured out how to do a top up on checkouts ??!!!

 2)Told we have to take holidays when they want so they can save hours to fit in with the restrictions on hours.. 
3)When a staff member is ill or on holiday it is rare that they will cover them so other already stretched staff are expected to take on yet more work.
4)With hours restricted, the little staff that are on have to prioritise jobs resulting in other jobs getting missed such as racking of over stock which then lead to stock going out of date in the back and later being wasted., restricted hours also lead to us rushing our jobs and date checks on shelves is not thorough leading to out of date stock still on shelves which customers have been known to point out to me and my collegues leading to embarrassment for us and asda, it also leads to  high waste which then leads to staff being lectured on waste volume but it is the structure they have on hours that causes this and they have their selves to blame no one else!! Yet they dont seem to blame them selves..
5)Hours restricted and jobs not getting done properly or not at all, leads to empty places on shelves resulting in customers commenting to us about it and again resulting in embarrassment for us and asda. 
6)already stretched on our own departments when queue busting is called we MUST go and work on a till wether we are busy or not (we are always busy) they have bern known to take me and the only other colleague on my department to queue bust leaving our department without a staff member for sometime.
7)Our rushed manner results in us rushing to take customers to products and not giving the full expected customer service that asda insist on and we are being tested on this via secret shoppers it is easy to fail given the amount of work we have and our rushed manner. This is not a fare test
8)better turn over leads to more hours but the restrictions on hours leads to poor turnover which then leads to restrictions in hours!! = we just cant win
9) when we are getting supposed surprise visit from the area manager, we know they are coming because other stores phone and warn us. Suddenly they are able to phone staff and ask them to come in and dish out a load of hours, all work is done as should be because there is enough staff! ...The store doesnt really work like that!!  But this proves it can if the right amount of staff is on
10) staff have been known to clock out and continue to work just to complete jobs they don't want to leave half done purely coz they dont want to let the team down.

ASDA,13/10/2015, Section Leader,"Current Employee, more than 5 years",,2,2,2,,3,2,2,x,r,v,"Smaller ""Supermarket"" Section Leader.",I enjoy working with most of my colleagues. It's a smaller local supermarket and I like the fact we form a relationship with customers.,"Although I don't mind, and at times really enjoy the tougher shifts; there's far too many tougher shifts which seem to be an uphill battle. 

This is usually due to the decisions made above us, like ridiculously low wage budgets, overly complex processes for what should be simple tasks. An awful ordering system that wastes so much time and money delivering what we don't need and a lack of what we do need (despite so much time invested in the processes).

As a Section Leader I feel I'm overworked and vastly under paid. It feels like we have to do the work of a Colleague plus a Manager as well as our own duties. We're often the Duty Manager for long periods and dealing with quite complex problems. I enjoy this challenge but feel I should be rewarded for it. I get just above minimum wage for this! 

We are under trained. I did my ""training"" over 3 weeks when I joined from Netto. It was basically a box ticking exercise. A series of people reading to us from dummy cards. If we asked questions we were usually met with the same answer from all, ""I don't know, this isn't my area, I'm just covering"". We then had to sign to say we'd had that area of ""training"".

We often make the joke, ""in order to progress at Asda, you have to sell your soul to Asda"". We are expected to do long shifts. We're contracted to 38 hours but it's taken for granted that we'll stay til a job is done. This is frustrating as the job would be done on time and to a better standard without the fact we're working with one arm tied behind our backs by those above, managing their figures to look good at our expense.

We learn as we go along, pick up new skills from other Section Leaders we meet and always have the feeling that we're missing something.
We have so many people in deadwood positions visiting, demanding we follow their rules and processes for their particular area of concern. It's not nearly possible to find the time to do any of this for even one of them. Never mind all of them. These are people simply trying to justify their job roles. 

I don't believe this is unique to Asda, it's the down side to working for a big corporation but it's just magnified ten fold when working in a small building.

In order to get on, you have to play the game. You'll thrive if you accept the bull, talk the talk. Say the right things, then when you get above, keep up the presence as though you didn't experience it yourself and carry on making the decisions that cause those bellow so much stress.

I have no ambition to go further and stay in this job as it's just a convenient location to me.

I will move on when I find a better alternative."

There is a great team spirit as everyone mucks in to help each other get the job done. 

Customers are usually nice, understanding and have low expectations as it is known as a cheap shop.

They do sometimes promote from within if you are willing to put in the hours and sing the corporate song - literally!

You will be busy, busy, busy which is good for people like me who like to feel useful not bored.

If you can handle the workload, at shop floor level it is not too stressful as section leaders and managers get all the heat.

Given how disorganised things are, it is very easy to get away with doing little to no work (also a con!)

Good union presence has led to reasonable benefits and treatment of most staff, or at least paying lip service to same.","Ridiculous pressure is put on section leaders who receive a very low wage for their level of responsibility.

Dead-end job: There seems little point trying to progress as you can work a long time as a section leader and never make it to management. Many section leaders step down again as it is a nightmare job for very little reward.

Chronic understaffing which only seems to be getting worse. There is never enough time to do a job properly, so most jobs are rushed and left half-finished by staff. Queue-busting (leaving your job to help out on checkouts) just exacerbates the problem. High workload and low staff leads to stress, staff absences and resignations, which leads to even lower staff numbers, ad infinitum.

Rotas are rarely updated on time, badly planned and sometimes you will find out after the fact that you were meant to be on shift. Due to low staffing and overworked section leaders there is often a lack of communication about rotas which leads to problems like this.

You are often alone on shift which is fairly miserable. Some people use this as an opportunity to do no work, which means more work for their colleagues who come on shift after them.

You have to work at least one day every weekend, and often evenings as well, often at little-to-no notice.

10% staff discount is lower than other supermarkets offer.

Lip service is paid to things like Health and Safety, which is then routinely ignored if it gets in the way of doing the job. Basically you have to sign a form to say you are aware of all H&S issues and will report any, the sole purpose of which seems to be to implicate you personally if you get injured at work. Eg, In my department's section of the warehouse the fire exit was routinely blocked by rails of highly flammable clothing which had nowhere else to be stored. This was hurriedly hidden elsewhere before a senior management inspection.

Store management at local level are doing the best they can, but can only follow the instructions of their corporate masters who turn a blind eye to anything inconvenient. They are all about numbers and don't seem to realise overworked, stressed, untrained staff will have a negative impact on their bottom line eventually."

The shift patterns, for me at least, are rubbish. Friday, Saturday and Sunday every week, when there are other staff who don't seem to do any weekends or night work. Guess it depends on the length of time you've worked there? It would make more sense if it was done on some kind of rota system, then at least I'd get to spend some weekends with my kids!

The management are terrible, no communication, constantly shanging my shift pattern without actually notifying or asking me. The senior management don't seem interested in even saying hello to you!

Never get your lunch at the time put down, (your name ""accidentally"" gets crossed out because they thought you've been already) always have to nag staff walking past that you haven't had your break yet.

Management look after their own, they have multiple prolonged breaks where they get takeaway food and treat select colleagues, but everyone else is timed by the second. Working in Langley mill you are not likely to get the job if you are not related to management, in which case you don't need any skills or qualifications. People work hard, others will just show their face and chat for 4-8 hours, but everyone is paid the same. If you are a section leader or manager you can walk around the shop and do your shopping during your shift, you can also take items off the shelf and pay for them at your convenience, if you remember to pay that is. If you are a colleague do not stand and talk ever, you must make sure you do the work load which used to be split between maybe 4 or 5 others because hours are constantly being cut. if you do arrive at work and realize you have left your name badge at home you had better be prepared to go home and retrieve it, even if is an hour commute on the bus on a bank holiday (which you have to work) but dont worry if you are close with management because your manager will just have a laugh with you about it and give you another, free of charge. You cannot expect to get a full weeks holiday if management don't prefer you, you must stagger it out throughout the year never exceeding 6 days at a time. Depending on your manager the rules vary to their liking. 
I would not recommend working for this company. Management are paid peanuts, and they get the job if their face fits, doesn't matter how good they are at the job, which means they do discriminate, they do favor certain colleagues and will make your life difficult if they want you to leave. 
At this job i was often finding myself reading up on laws because these guys have no idea what the laws are and do break them, constantly. when i tried to report issues to higher management they would advise you didn't raise a complaint as it would effect managements friendships. Once when a formal complaint was passed to a manager she read the form, which has to be processed and action must be taken, she took it read it and screwed it up in front of the poor colleague and threw it in the bin saying she would not go against another manager."

One to one reviews just never happened. Infact, I didn't even get a leaving interview. I felt like I'd given them 6 years of my life and they hadn't even noticed I'd gone.
Would I recommend working there? No. It's OK if you're a university student just working seasonal for a bit of pocket money, but the wages are awful, (£9.65 an hour on nights), and there are very few opportunities to progress due to the fact that they've done away with most of the management now. Section leaders are paid £1 an hour more that regular colleagues but are expected to work longer hours and get a Hell of a lot of grief.
The only thing that made the whole thing bearable were the friends I made during my time there."

- I was the only person trained on newspapers and magazines, but I was only given three shifts a week. The other four days were ""covered"" by someone who had to do it on top of their other job and didn't know how to do it. Hundreds of papers/magazines were wasted each week, left on the shelves for days, or left unreturned to the printer. My manager always gave me the blame.

- Because I only had three shifts a week, I had to work another part-time job at another big company. I passed out cold one evening at my other workplace through tiredness and stress. Due in at Asda at 6am the next morning, I called in sick so I could rest, fearing I'd pass out again. Told Asda I'd been unable to see a doctor yet because of the timing of it, but that they could call my manager at my second job if they needed confirmation. They refused, and I was given a yellow warning - one disciplinary away from being fired. Apparently if you have worked there less than six months, you don't get the luxury of being ill.

- My manager was rarely working at the same time as me so I couldn't talk to him about my frustrations. I left him messages, which were always ignored.

I would have 8/9 cages and I would have to take them one by one through the back yard, through the back warehouse and into the freezer without gloves and I don't have a huge amount of strength and not enough time, i really could have done with some help, I definitely would have stuck out the job if I did. In addition, the poor man that trained me had an AWOL which I understand is unacceptable but the fact that ASDA then used him for 2 days to train me and then sacked him is disgusting and I would never have expected this to happen. Also, he had a feeling he was being released and had never trained anyone before and wasn't trained to train someone. Therefore, I did not receive the correct training and had to basically learn everything by asking other colleagues as I was thrown in the deep end on my own.

Also, you'll sign a contract but will be told to change the days you can work with a week's notice, which defeats the purpose of signing a contract, especially when you are frowned upon for not agreeing to their terms.

Nice mixture of people who on the whole were a joy to work with.
Its a relatively secure job.
The work is easy","Pay is now only minimum wage. 
You will have a basic contract which is normally a 8 hour weekend flex but there will be overtime however even if you were to do the same hours overtime wise week and week they are massively reluctant to contract you to it. 
Everyone is very stressed and very overworked causing moral to be through the floor due to a lack of other colleagues in terms of staffing levels and help from management. 
The management at store level is massively, massively lacking in ever sense oft the word. From lack of support to complete lack of  communication and even though they cannot accept it there is very much a 'us and them' culture.
When you have a visit from head office management (area manager and up) it becomes a comical farce because then there is pandemonium and only then  will you see the management try and take control in order to get the credit.
Praise and acknowledgment is very slow in coming if indeed you ever receive any at all.
Training used to be excellent now your just thrown on the department with a very basic idea of what to do and expected to just do it. The work is easy but not until you know what you are doing.
Colleagues are treated in general poorly. There is nothing to motivate you in general to do a good job and so a lot of people just don't. Things like breakfast of a morning have been taken away. The bonus received yearly has been massively reduced  to the point none of us even recognise it.   
They are undergoing a mass 'reinvention' in order to make them more competitive due to the struggles that have been well documented in the news. This has been handled badly and is causing untold issues for customers and colleagues alike. 
My advice to you would be to walk around the store before you join and look at staffing levels on the shop floor, the level of product on the shelves and the general happiness of the staff it will tell you a lot before you start. 
Asda is all about the customer however it is severely neglecting its colleagues and now it really isn't a good place to work and the customers are dwindling down in numbers. Improve things for colleagues and the store as a whole will improve!."

Little evidence that the advertised commitment to ethics and values is taken seriously by senior management.
Culture of fear at senior management level.
Flexible working not understood - being able to work on a laptop all night at home after a 12 hour day in the office isn't really flexible working.  Condensed hours not available because they'd end up with people only working 4-day-weeks, but you can work for no pay instead."

Furthermore, there is some degree of flexibility with shifts and hours worked. However, this is very dependent on the willingness of the management team - which often leaves a lot to be desired.","There are numerous. The biggest downsides in my opinion are the following:

- Atrocious management. I was never personally introduced to the store manager, and the only contact I ever get with any managers (not team leaders/section leaders) is when they decide to give me a new task that has absolutely nothing to do with my actual job, or they decide to complain about something. As the saying goes: ""Once I did wrong and that I heard ever; twice I did good but that I heard never"".
- Unfair absence policy. I called in sick once, and was explicitly warned (without ANY sympathy to the fact that I was actually very unwell on that day) that if I was to take another day off during the probationary period (12 weeks), I'd most likely lose my job.
- Zero value. I feel that no-one in the store really cares at all about me as an individual, or even as an employee. The only person in a management position (section leader) who actually cared about me was one of the youngest people there. Anyone in a senior rank than you (and even those who simply perceive themselves to be so) simply does not care. It is quite depressing frankly, knowing that you are essentially treated as a well-paid slave to the company."

I applied for a Job in groceries and was given something completely different. I felt like I was just somebody filling in a space and under valued. I was given a job that wasn't for me however I accepted it  (what did have to loose). First day of shift was awful, was introduced to section leader for 2 minutes then was told to go do my job, no training at all or heads up on anything. When I asked them general questions they didn't answer them or show any care or engagement.
The person who sorted out hiring me wasn't helpful. When I approached her to ask if their was anything else available she didn't look into it and was rude towards me. When I asked about doing a different role she said I wasn't capable of doing it (I just wanted todo something like groceries or staking shelves!, their were open jobs available) I am perfectly capible of doing that.

When I called to resign I was passed around from place to place, different people. They haven't evan paid me since I had that conversation and I doubt they will.

All its competitors pay more, some quite significantly yet ASDA continues to under perform financially - and its a downward trend. Any correlation?

Behind the cheery family facade there is low morale. To make a decent wage significantly more hours than contracted need to be worked. This is what ASDA rely on, people desperate for more hours that say yes at the expense of their work life balance. The work culture dictates that if you say no sometimes then other requests may be viewed unfavourably. Take that as you will.

Poor holiday entitlement, no opportunity for rostered weekends off. Would a shift system really be that difficult? Lots of staff on different contracts doing same job.

The cynical side of me thinks the only reason they give 10% discount is because ASDA want the money back they begrudgingly paid you in wages."

- Can get overtime across multiple departments
- Most customers are pretty reasonable","- Low contracts (8-12 hours usually) combined with semi-regular overtime bans and cut-backs mean hours are not reliable. Only way to get a full time contract would be to become a section leader. This despite understaffing in most departments. Our department can't afford to replace workers who left on part time contracts but apparently can afford two section leaders on full time higher pay? Then they wonder why the profits are slimming....

- Rotas changed at shorrt notice, unsocial hours. I'm lucky in that I don't need a full time wage at the moment so I can turn down ridiculous shifts demanded the night before but some colleagues are not so lucky and managers take advantage of that.

- Section leaders are useless no power to actually implement any changes or support workers but paid more for relaying management orders.

- Management is incredibly indiscrete,  very gosspiy atmosphere. Playing favourites and politics between managers and departments.

-Constant reinforcement of 'family' ethos contrasts with huge pressure for departments and stores to compete against each other.

-Middle-management only help out if there is a visit and even then only sporadically. Very uncommunicative (will only send messages through section leaders even if you have directly approached them about something) and unresponsive to shop-floor-level staff's complaints. Incredibly uncaring about chronic health issues or other problems staff may have and will discipline you rather than engage if you complain

Managers restructure that saw some very good and skilled managers leave but some not so skilled managers stay! The reduction in colleague's leaving stores looking unstocked with gaps in almost all aisles as we do not have enough colleagues to keep up with the work load. It's as if Head office forgets that customers are in the store and are asking colleagues where items are. They must think we just refill stock all day with nothing getting in our way. And on top of that most of our shop floor colleagues are on checkouts for most of the shift due to lack of colleagues for checkouts and queue build up. The company also makes a big fuss over area manager visits. If the store looks good it's only because the area manager is due to visit not because we want to WOW our customers. I think such visits should be out of the blue to keep stores in top condition all of the time. It's the customers we need to impress no the managers. Asda recently stopped its £20 gift card at Christmas for colleagues. This is a little thing that colleagues liked and it all helps for those who are not on full time contracts which are hard to get now. A new computer system and lack of tanning.

The job is EXHAUSTING, at least for the new comers, they give 40 deliveries a day to the new guys and 20 to the older employees, and when you carry peolpe's shopping all day up and down flats your back starts to hurt.
The shifts were two, first one starts from 7 am and the other one starts at 2 pm, i used to work 8 hours every day but many days i had so many deliveries that i worked 10 or sometimes 11 hours, and with NO BREAKS!!! i never had a single break!! i worked 5 months there and i always worked 9 hours straight with not a single break ever, not even to eat lunch, i used to eat an apple or a sandwitch while driving in between deliveries.
Some of the older drivers did have a bit of time for breaks because they had less deliveries.
I worked there over the winter, so it was always so cold, and was raining most of the days and i remember getting home at night completely soaked, even my underwear were wet from the rain...
I dont know how i lasted that long there but i had to pay the rent, and obviously in the meantime i was looking for other jobs and as soon as i found another i quit.
And on top of all this, the salary was minimun, 6.50 at the time, while other companies for the same position pay 10 or 11.

Customers who are abusive to staff are often rewarded with a good will payment and whatever it is they wanted whether it is legal or not, the use of healthy start vouchers for prohibited products and the sale of alcohol to a group of people not all of whom can prove their age, are the most common examples. Anyone who is not inclined to brown nose has no hope of any sort of promotion or even overtime unless it's on ASDAs terms. Flat rate pay, no higher rate for evenings sundays etc. ..."

No such thing as a reasonable request or response if you decline a shift or need a day off for a reason.
Management quick to blame you and won't take anything you say as a valid point (from personal experiences) if they think your wrong then your wrong even if your not and this gets proven. Treat you differently if you've made them look silly.

- Management believe that no one has a social life outside of work
- Lazy work from management shoves the consequences of their actions onto their subordinates and blames them for not getting the work done
- Someone needs to give the managers a f*cking A-Level Business textbook because the information in it means that I could probably run that sh*thole in Peterborough better singlehandedly than they could.

I have witnessed the opposite and management even telling customers that their colleagues are in the wrong etc when they haven't been just make themselves look good.

Do this job and eventually something will happen to you, ie accidents and injuries are commonplace, no matter how careful you are. Half the drivers are off sick with bad backs, knees, shoulders, and work related stress.

complaints are dealt with well, particularly ethical issues","the company changes its processes regularly, nothing stays the same for very long. quite often they'll change the way something is done and within a month it'll have changed back again. occasional jumped up managers, some managers/team leaders communicate poorly
management was restructured a few years back and a lot of people lost their jobs. a lot of employee benefits e.g. canteens were lost, the company try to scrimp and save wherever they can which is quite often a bit of a curse. therefore now it's more difficult to step up anywhere from section leader. section leaders were then burdened with managers' work for the same rubbish wage (and therefore they often don't care about the job!)
flexible but quite boring/time consuming as a full time endeavour unless you step up to management and deal with the rubbish thrown at you - often not worth the wage for what you're expected to do!

This colleague would follow me round the store on my shifts and would keep asking for hugs.  Many of my fellow colleagues had similar situations and had reported it with nothing being done but as I was still classed a child and spoke up and many others followed and finally they took action and fired the colleague. It disgusts me how long this had been going on and could have been stopped and not happened to me if they'd got effective management. This in affect impacted me as a person and continues too, I felt anxious and awful with no support after I was scared to go into work. The management took me seriously and dealt with it swiftly however they didn't communicate with me and I had to find out what had happened resultantly from other colleagues.  Some management there especially head management were very active in helping out within the store a credit to them for coming round and motivating the team. However Section Leaders are paid pennies more for working ridiculously shifts and hours, always being so kind and patient I honestly felt so bad for many of them especially with families, some of them were the most lovely people i don't know how they did it.  They aren't flexible with hours and holiday and my manager pushed me out saying there wasn't a place for me anymore and I was best to leave.. which after 2 years of working there was quite upsetting. I was never given extra hours in summer which was insulting as I was better trained and more efficient than all the seasonal staff and I was not given even one extra shift, would make more sense to keep trained and experienced workers who could do the click and collect side, loading and home shopping picking."

They have a relatively new IT director who seemed like a really nice guy, he is however hamstrung by having poisonous managers reporting to him. Often heard members of the management team say “they wouldn’t understand, they never worked in stores like us”.  

I often witnessed people actively be bullied by senior management and talked to like children, whilst using vindictive ways to make people feel uncomfortable in their role. There was always a decent level of “sickness” around the department.

Promotions and opportunities are offered to those who suck up to senior management most.

I accepted an exit interview from HR after I resigned. I spent 20 minutes explaining what I had witnessed and my experiences, to which the lady sat there and nodded and said “oh that’s not good” and didn’t document anything I said. She then asked me about anything positive I could draw from my time, I told her the very few things I noted above, she then spent the next 10 minutes writing them down and asked me if I could expand on them. This just summarises the company perfectly.

Keeping good out of work personal relations with DMs also helps a lot.,"Very unfair in the way they approach colleagues, based on personal relations with colleagues managers instantly take sides when any issue is reported and cover up for colleagues they are friends with or are their family members. Similar thing happens when it comes to pick rates, downtime and H&S where people with connections aren't being challenged for misconduct while other face disciplinary actions for minor things. Many ""special"" colleagues sit for hours chatting with mangers (not a downtime) and severely abuse their break times but managers ignore it while other are expected to explain being late from brake 2 minutes, and often those 2 minutes happened 2 month earlier. This is a very bad place to work, there is absolutely no support for colleagues from senior managers, they always take DM's side and discard any complains."

being out on the road","Right Cons :

I have worked here for coming up to 2 years this year! when I first started it was great could deliver early to customers if they are in which in turn meant I could be finished and back home nice and early !

Now though they have a 20min rule! which means I can be sat around in a layby or if I'm lucky I go home for over a hr waiting now image this you have 1hr to waste your in the middle of nowhere its 8 at night the outside temp is -5 if you leave the van idling you get scored down on your driving ! so your sat freezing so you can get your star points! ..

Next I am pretty good at this job and its an instore joke that I will be the first van back! and here lies the next problem...because I can ""bang"" them out I get shafted with the biggest run every time I go in ! 

on a sunday I am always the second to last van out .....but wait now I am the first van with the biggest drop! ...it gets better there was no loader/ no paper work printed and I was due out in 13mins so I had to do all that myself ...why was there no loader because they never cover them!

On to my next point: if you struggle at this job then you get looked after by which I mean you will get a nice 6 drop (beause your struggling) 

The vans oh boy the vans 8/10 the tyres are right on the limit the services are never done on time they are generally still filthy even after the whole WATCHDOG thing!

At the moment they are advertising the gob as 8.50 -9.55 !!!! 9.55 is night rate you will only be contract till 10 at night to get night rate on the new ""flexible contract"" you would need to be there till after 12!

No pressure to 'hard sell' or upsell - the pricing structure in the Opticians means you can comfortably provide whatever your patient needs. 
Culture of honestly and openness within the business. Mistakes and failures are treated like a learning opportunity rather than a stick to beat you with.","No/little support if needed - senior management in stores have little to no interest or experience in healthcare, and regional healthcare managers are spread over a massive area, so you'll be lucky to see them twice a year, and generally they have no healthcare experience - more interested in a 4 foot accessory bay because that's what they understand. 
Staffing levels are tight, which is understandable in a low cost business, but becomes dangerously short staffed if someone leaves or goes off sick - it can take months to get approval to recruit. 
Quality of support staff is massively variable, you're more likely to be forced to take on staff that can no longer lift and carry in a warehouse, regardless of if they are suitable and capable of working in an Opticians as it's seen as an 'easy' department. 
Hours are long. Very long. Full time is 45 hours a week, and you'll routinely need to do significantly more than that because you'll usually have to cover someone's holiday, sickness, etc. 
Only an illusion of career progression for the ambitious - annual appraisals and regular performance conversations but regional healthcare manager jobs are not advertised, they are given to well performing George or Home Shopping managers with connections, unless you want to be a supermarket manager, you can not progress, I am not aware of any Optical Managers that have been promoted in the last 4 years - maybe possible if you live near Leeds head office but I'm not aware of it happening.

Good length contract. When I had to take time off for a serious illness, they were completely understanding and respectful.

With some jobs, they will leave you to it.","They do demand too much from some colleagues, for example, sometimes they will expect one person to do jobs meant for three different ones, and do them in the time   it would take three people to do them.

The system for working stock from the back-up is flawed. Unless it is done 100% correctly, 100% of the time (which it never is), then you can end up with the back-up looking really heavy.

If you didn't sign up for the new contracts that came into force in 2017, you are paid National Living Wage, which is great for under 25s, but not so for over 25s.

I do not recommend becoming a section leader unless you are happy to be paid only an extra £1 an hour, and have essentially the same duties and work the same hours as a manager. I have known colleagues who left a section leader position, because they could not handle the pressure."

ASDA,10/4/2019, Shop Floor Assistant,"Former Employee, more than 8 years","Oldham, England, England",3,4,1,,1,2,2,v,r,v,Was very good but gone downhill.,"- The people I've met whilst working at Asda are some of the most funniest and humble. Had some really good times along with them and I still see them from time to time. 

- Some of the perks are pretty decent if used on a consistent basis such as the 10percent discount (20percent at certain times of the year) and the Asda Perks website which gives you discount to cinema tickets and days out events etc...

- The hours are there if wanted (well the store I was in had hours due to their recruitment policies which I'll explain down in cons later).  So basically, I had a contract which was part time but from time to time I used to do full time hours with the added benefit of my holiday allowance being adjusted for the extra hours I have done.

- Even though I had a contract, section leader allowed me to be flexible in terms of my working hours. This allowed me to take care of some of my personal stuff that needed my attention. 

- There are people who have worked at Asda for years and know the colleague hand book inside out and are willing to help you out once you are in trouble. 

- I have had the pleasure of working under some of the best line managers you could ask for. They would guide and encourage you in order to be best in what you are doing. That encouragement is all that is needed in order to feel appreciated. 

Some managers have even agreed with what cons I will mention soon as they believe the shop floor workers are getting the short end of the stick such as Sunday pay.

- With it being local to me, I had literally no cost. This is an advantage for those who want the benefit of a local job. 15-20 mins walk depending if i was in zombie mode.

- Booking of annual leave is easy enough. Except for one time, all my annual leave request had been accepted. Only time you can't book annual leave is Xmas week and new years for obvious reasons.","- Pay was a bit lacking. They tried to con you with ""Paid Breaks"" when they compared themselves alongside Tesco. Also, there was a reason why most people would try and avoid working Sundays due to no extra supplement on Sunday working -  which personally I thought was a bit of a sad thing. 

- When I first started, training was decent. You budded up with someone for around a week as you get to know the store and the way Asda expects you to provide customer service. 

When I went back for my second stint, I was in a batch of people that Asda was their first job and training was non-existent. Literally, they struggled to find their feet and confidence. Don't get me wrong it's not hard working in a supermarket. However, you need the training and guidance if it is the first job you've had.

- As time went on, people left without being replaced (I understand the landscape for shopping has completely changed with the internet and the smaller stores such as Aldi picking up some of the business that Asda would've always had therefore there needs to be a limit of staff). This made existing workers pick up 2+ people worth of work which sometimes could be accomplished while other times could not be. 

Due to the expectation for you to do this by certain managers, people used to get fed up and ring up sick or go awol which made those who were already in be bogged down in more work.

- ""We listening"" survey. Each year Asda conducts this. Now in the store I worked at, rumours were flying about regarding the survey results being ""modified"". This was also confirmed in confidence by a deputy store manager, fresh trade manager and a section leader. 

I have pulled managers regarding the end results and how each year you have different ways of showing the stats and how its convenient that certain departments are being clumped together in order to get a decent score of morale etc... No one's ever replied back to me with a answer to it. 

Basically ""We listening"" survey is a CON. 

- Certain section leaders need to get a life and learn how to people manage. This job is about management of people and goods. If you don't have people then you won’t have the goods in store in order for the customers to buy.

Problem is there is a stigma with section leader’s job. Good people with good sense won't go for it as there is HARDLY any career progression. I should know as I have seen it with my own very eyes."

No possibility of career progression for non-full-time staff (most of us).
Work is gruelling compared to most other retail jobs I've worked.
As is typical for Walmart globally, the central company has no respect for workers. They are currently trying to cut everyone's pay and conditions by forcing a new contract on the workforce, who will otherwise face the sack.
Jobs that used to be consider 7/8 hour jobs are now 6 hours. Therefore, wages are effectively cut for many, and those jobs are far more strenuous than they were previously.
Some customers are extremely abusive and the management doesn't do too much about it.
Many of the managers are racist towards travelling community customers who shop there and pay for their goods like anyone else does."

Good for part timers 
There is always something to do 
Maybe the discount card for when it's double discount otherwise it doesn't make much difference.","Don't turn up to work on time as they class this as late. But also don't turn up more than 15 minutes earlier than your start time as they will not pay you those extra minutes. This may sound like those minutes do not matter but if you work an extra 15 minutes every shift for 5 days that's over an hours worth of work you've done for them for free!  You are always given unrealistic amounts of work to do in a short space of time that you'll never get done in time and to the standard your meant to do it to. This is so the manager can have ago at you for unfinished work. The managers enjoy belittling there staff and making sure other staff know how much ork you haven't done. Even if you do get all the work done they will always find more for you to do and then complain you haven't finished that!
You do not get paid for any breaks and must take your break even if you don't want to. You'll still loose your break and will not be paid for working through it. They do not like you going to the toilet while at work this must be while on your break. So if like me they make you go on your break at 12pm and then you don't get another break till 7pm that's a long time holding in a pee. If you do go to the toilet and your manager finds out they will time you and frighten to take that time off your break.
You have to work a weekend shift and it's almost impossible to get the day off unless taken as a holiday or unpaid leave.
If you stay later then 15 minutes after your shift has ended you must make sure your manager knows otherwise you wont get paid for the extra. You also have to work every bank holiday unless you book it as a holiday or as a day unpaid. You do not get paid any more for working a bank holiday this only applies at Christmas where you get paid time and half. Your not allowed to book a holiday around Christmas and may only get Christmas day off. Managers only see you as a number and not as a person as they couldn't care less if your struggling to do the work as you may have an injury etc. Don't expect to ever get full time work  unless your best friends with ""benefits"" with the manager."

Job itself is pretty easy, however...","1. No concern for staff welfare. Many staff are signed off sick due to stress.
2. Serious problems with security (shoplifting is rampant) 
3. Major issues in communication between departments and managers
4. Massive cutbacks to staff meaning departments are poorly stocked and staff are overwhelmed
5. Major issues with management. Poor communication. Everyone is out for themselves. Everything takes too long. Admin are a joke. 
6.No proper training!
7. Aggressive attitude to sick days and time off

Honestly, Asda is a horrific place to work. I'm leaving as soon as I can get another job.  I've never worked anywhere so disorganised. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm so stressed out all the time. There is no concern for staff welfare. Staff are routinely harassed and verbally assaulted, even harassed by customers on social media. Management do not care. Only look at numbers and figures. Senior staff members undermine section leaders all the time. 

Too many staff leaving and not being replaced. Shoplifters are never prosecuted so they return all the time. No one really cares anymore about Asda, we all just do the bare minimum. Also, too much staff theft going on without repercussions (no police action. If you're caught stealing, the police should get involved. But no, not at Asda! You'll just be asked if you'd like to resign instead)  

Don't work at Asda. JUST DON'T!"

Good people (employees) to work with, good benefits; Sharesave, Pension, staff discount doubled occasionally throughout the year.","Following enforcement of the new contract 6 in November 2019, Asda have now enforced a change to the job spec. Delivery drivers are now expected to load own vans - a job previously done very well and efficiently by experienced Service Crew. This is practically doubling the workload in one fell swoop. It's a physically demanding role without this. Failure to agree to the change will result in breach of contract apparently, and could lead to dismissal if you also refuse to accept another store role. Contract 6 has been dubbed the 'Martini' contract - Anytime, any place, anywhere - (70's tv ad apparently!) which means you'll be moved when it suits them. 
Google ""Asda workers"".
If you're looking to drive for Asda and are prepared to do the physical loading on top of the actual delivery role then fine, it's just the enforcing of change on existing employees that is wrong.
Holiday requests are turned down more often than you would imagine leading to resentment and unauthorized absences. 
Junior, store management ineffective where employees are concerned and are 'toeing the Company line' even where they know themselves it's unfair."

Certain staff are allowed to be on their mobiles on the shop floor, eat, waste time talking with personal friends, ""run errands"" for section leaders or runners

You don't really need to think about much, if you can read and understand how numbers work there is little on the shop floor to challenge you.

In my store at least, most of the staff were friendly, and look out for each other. Most managers are also completely reasonable: they understand that they have to work with their subordinates and cannot rule by fear. Plenty of jokes and laughs when appropriate, genuinely a big family culture","Dealing with moronic co-workers, however this is usually short lived. As stated above, most people are nice enough, but the turnover rate of new staff is incredibly high primarily due to their own stupidity: theft, turning in drunk, late, not at all, lying about things that can very easily be checked. The potential pitfall here is that if a manager or established member of staff takes a dislike to you early on it can spell the end- though if you are there long enough and make an acceptable impression you are likely in a job for as long as you want it.

The new contract is definitely worse than the one I was on, but the provisions in it seemingly were not exploited by management whilst I was there - although I never signed. This is part of a larger trend of reduced benefits which began before my time- one long standing coworker had stock in Walmart worth a substantial amount, which was gifted to them upon completing their probationary period!"

 around each department","* Very fast paced work. Expectations set but the head office (that never visit) are unrealistic and unreachable without cheating the system. We are always behind on picks. I have been told off and had two meeting for working according to all the store policies. Considering that previous employers all said I’m hard working and this is the only one telling me that I’m too slow says a lot.

Managers are only trained once upon promotion and that’s it. You can’t introduce new ideas for operation (on a considerable scale) as it has to come from the higher ups (that I have never seen). 

No customer limit during COVID. Store has been way too packed (with queues passing the aisles) since the government removed their strict limit. Impossible to social distance and work. Customer are right beside at almost all times.

No cheap staff food. They removed the catering service and wasted money refurbishing the break room (hid all evidence that we used to have a catering service. 

Expected to work like robots. You get I trouble for speaking to colleagues, especially if they see you laughing. Talcom guns go missing all the time because colleges don’t trust each other to put them back when they are done. If it wasn’t for the terrible music playing on the radio, you wouldn’t hear a whisper during the night shift because people don’t talk to each other on the shop floor.

Word of advice is to avoid at all costs. If you are stuck for choices and have to earn money then try and earn as much experience in each department and get trained on all the equipment. This will boost your resume for when you eventually leave."

- 10% discount for life if you're continuously employed for for 20+ years.
- Free tea, coffee & milk (when it isn't out!).
- Free Christmas lunch if you work days.
- Occasional free buffet for selected occasions (both for days and nights).
- Occasional extra small treats though the year.
- TV room.
- On the whole the staff are really nice.
- Wal*Mart did a good job of clearing up the previous management culture and most managers are now actually quite good and supportive.
- Night staff effectively get early access to some offers as we're the ones restocking them.
- Bonus in February, which I'm told will be 100% (1 week's pay) this year for all permanent colleagues.
- Small discretionary bonus (""Star points"") can be given by managers.
- Lots of company run training opportunities for those wanting to progress into management.
- Always seem eager for decent seasonal staff, who as I understand it get 10% off during the 20% week(s) in December.","- All paid breaks have been removed.
- Break entitlement has been cut.
- Extra pay for overtime, days off in lieu etc have all gone.
- Despite the crowing about how they're going to give ""hardworking colleagues"" Boxing day off this isn't happening for nights. In fact we're expected to work both Christmas eve and Boxing day whereas days have the later off. At my store even the cleaners have been told they will get Boxing day off with pay.
- For night colleagues New Year's eve is now a normal shift with normal pay.
- Nights apparently no longer get seasonal staff.
- A few night staff never get the free Christmas buffet (used to be dinner), whereas days can get up to two even though in theory that shouldn't happen.
- The communal thermal freezer coats are filthy and disgusting. And apparently never washed.

- Damaged store equipment seems to take forever to be replaced. At my store we have a significant shortage of stalls and pallet trucks, both apparently being damaged by surprisingly frequent accidental forklift collisions. The lack of trucks makes the work much, much harder and I'd suggest the lack of undamaged stalls is dangerous.

- We have no thermal trousers, shoe liners or balaclavas for work in the freezer. I'm told these is only available to depo workers even though on a couple of occasions I've been in freezer backup for 3+ hours sorting and racking the overstock that days hasn't done.

- Chasing pay issues has been made more difficult as the punch details are now locked away and no one on nights ever seems to have the key.

- If you want to see personnel you have to do it in your own time as they almost never start early.

- In the past I've had to pressure personnel over star points as they seem reluctant to actually credit them.

- Getting your door access card set up (or more likely re-set up as mine keeps getting deleted from the system) is a chore. Like personnel, security is rarely in early and even when they are they drag their feet. I've even known night managers to have to wait 2+ weeks for their card to be put on the system and my personal record is a little over 6 months.

- Uniform ordering is a shambles. I've been waiting nearly two years for new uniform and only had 1x polo shirt (correct size), 1x 'temp worker' polo shirt, 2x ""wrong order"" (i.e. oversize) polo shirts and no new trousers. In fact my one and only pair of trousers are so bad I'm having to cut sections out of an older pair to patch the holes. I've also re-sewn the rear multiple times. Many others have resorted to buying their own.

- I've never been to the (apparently now discontinued) company Christmas party. Previously there was money available for those who were working to do their own but for some reason nights never got it. And that's despite the fact that some day staff joined us."

As a section leader so much responsibility is put on you for the very little extra pay you get (£1 and hour) and are expected to do the same if not more work than the managers and also do the work of a colleague.

Any issues that arise section leaders are expected to deal with meaning in every situation we are the bad guy in the eyes of management and colleagues.

Section leaders are glorified punching bags for everyone to take their anger out on. Not worth the slight pay increase, STAY AS A COLLEAGUE"

Company shop is excellent.
Many options to better yourself with courses you can book yourself in to.
A diverse range of people and skills.
Senior management approachable.
Transparent weekly huddles to let staff know how the company is performing.
Employees tend to stay once they are in.
Encouraged to move around and change roles to learn different areas of the business.
Would work there again as the benefits are brilliant.","Many of the roles are very high pressure to save money, hence the company benefits to compensate for mental health.
There are some characters that have worked there for years that are known for bullyboy tactics and that is overlooked due to them being great at their job. In my 2 years there I saw many people crying due to the pressure and being spoke to quite badly, resulting in flurries of people leaving.
You can be at the company years, absolutely brilliant at your iob, and meet all your targets, but if you don't put your face around and purposefully socialise with top management, promotions are denied. It's part of the ""asda way""."

- Sometime a yearly bonus","Note that this may not apply to all stores. Just my personal experience with one store and what I took away from the experience.
- managers are driven by profit
- managers don't have a regard for staffs personal life and availability, it is expected for you to be available even though you say that you are not
- it is is expected that you do more hours than what you are contracted to do because Asda doesn't want to give full time contracts. Doesn't benefit them and having full time staff makes, them loose money (due to more rights to those staff) so part time workers tend to be pressured to do overtime. 
- when staff whom were contracted to do nearly full time left, a replacement would not be hired. For example we had a full time staff leave and they were still not replaced even after a year has passed causing the current staff to substitute in to cover their shift. At some point other staff left and I ended up doing a job which would need 2 and half number of staff to complete. If you don't complete it you are viewed as lazy or not motivated. The blame is placed on staff even though everyone is requesting for more staff to be hired. 
I've worked for other retailers for many years and this one gave me a lot of anxiety and stress."

No recognition of hard work as all the recognition goes to managers that talk the talk and sit in the office with the GSM all day. Regional managers haven't got a clue when they come and visit as they are so far out of touch with how to run a store. Ecommerce has become the focal point of asda but no investment into this therefore means they take the only colleagues you have and send them onto there to pick all day no questions asked without been able to transfer wages so therefore cannot get another colleague in.

I unfortunately stayed around for 2.5yrs, trying to move sections away from the older, nastier ladies (easy 40,50,60yrs old) who when I complained about the bullying were simply 'set in their ways'. It was like school all over again. Nothing was ever done about it, not even when investigations were held into awful situations I was subject too. I cannot remember a week going by without leaving work upset because of some awful remark, snide comment or being laughed at. It wasn't just me, I saw it happen to others too. 

I was given awful jobs no one else wanted to do. Two of my set shifts were finishing at 8pm and starting the next day at 6am (which isn't legal), this was uncontracted overtime that had somehow become permanent. When I tried to drop this, I was told the hours couldn't be moved so I would loose 4hrs a week. I was only on 20hrs do to loose 4 is a big chunk. 

I stayed there for so long due to my confidence being absolutely destroyed and feeling like I had no where else to go. I'd not long moved to the area and I was unfamiliar with my surroundings still, also trying to pay rent and bills at the same time. I was eventually helped move on by a friend. My notice was 1 week and I said bye to the people I worked with, my manager however gave me one last stare and left. No goodbye, nothing. 

I cannot say everyone was bad at asda, I met a few amazing people there who were all there for short periods of time. My notice was 1 week and I literally walked out those doors and never stepped foot back in that horrible, toxic environment. The best thing I ever did was leave. Its definitely left me with a few scars, I was never bullied that badly luckily throughout school, nevermind in a supposed adult environment.

The company covers some really interesting technologies and there were opportunities to learn lots about emergent tech trends which could shape the site and various tech products in the company further. This ""give it a go"" attitude is something they should be proud of.

Fortnightly sample sales are good but over the years less good stuff was in them - I think the buyers themselves started to take anything they want home for themselves.","For a company where it's shop window and everything behind it relies totally on IT, the directors seem to know soo little about IT and as a result have gone through a chain of hiring sociopath to sociopath to be in charge of large parts of or all of IT over the years. They want a new, interesting company like ASOS to be linked to their career and use big names of other (often much more stuffy) business to get in through the door, then pull the IT department back into the 20th century. 

The worst one was a recent CIO hire who started with a statement of intent of who they are and what they want to and don't want to do. Very quickly each of these promises was broken. Even worse, heads under them were replaced by people they had worked with in every company from the past 6-10 years of their career. These people were not brought in on merit. The result was a very strong cult of personality driving people out of the company, a swelling contract budget (more mates brought in) and importantly very little credible, long term value to the business. Having worked at the company for a long time it made me sick to see such a sought after and popular company get taken in by these people.

ASOS,23/10/2015, Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"London, England, England",5,5,5,,5,5,5,v,v,v,So refreshing to be in a company like ASOS!,"Collaborative company where you feel truly cared about. I was so surprised when I joined ASOS at just how different the environment was to other places I'd worked. I already knew a few people that worked at ASOS and asked them what they thought of the company before I made my decision to join. The feedback from them was a resounding 'they really look after you' and that's exactly what I've experienced.

Opportunity to grow  quickly within the company, flexible hours and just trusting employees in general, good basic salary for the retail industry, great package, from flexi cash and bonus all the way to more niche things like bicycle scheme and holiday vouchers and having your birthday off work.

Amazing like-minded people who don't treat you as competition but as colleagues and friends, a company and brand to feel proud of, exciting things happening within the business and being able to feel proud of it.

Cool company feel and office space, awesome canteen, really buzzing and exciting atmosphere to be in. 

Strong feeling that the Exec really care about the company which in return makes you really care. The CEO is in the office every day working like everyone else. He doesn't even have his own office, but sits in an open-plan amongst the rest of the employees.

The work ASOS are doing in CSR- the fact we have our own foundation and do tons of charity work is a massive plus for me. Working in a fashion company you can sometimes feel that what you're doing might not, in fact, 'really matter'. ASOS has such a focus on its charity work and every year sends its employees out to help build schools for homeless children in India, and wells in villages in Africa. They also encourage people to raise money all-year round, and are constantly organising fundraising events. It makes you feel really proud to be part of a company that focuses so much on doing good.","Can sometimes feel like there is so much we want to do and talk about doing, yet don't physically have the time to do it because of how fast-paced the environment is. I guess that's just down to prioritising workload."

If your pay is wrong there is little comeback. As regards flex hours you may be expected to begin shift two hours early at a moments notice and in spite of accumulating hours many employees' were asked to pay back hours! Ironically some were told to give back a week in overtime despite never being involved in any flex. When questioned HR would say they had access to information unavailable to Team Leaders rendering the Team Leader function a tad pointless. I feel HR didnt have control of the hours since being taken over twice.
Oh and the handscanners are faulty so even though you can arrive in the car park 15mins early, by the time you use the clock in system inside it can reset and then go past the time expected in by a few seconds. Then the company charge you 15mins of pay for lateness.
Targets are so high you can only achieve them by nearly breaking your neck, and if you have an accident you jeapordise employment. Good employees are treated like something on the bottom of your shoe, the lazy ones do well amazingly. Shift Managers waltz around like the second coming but I had no respect for the ones on despatch pick or pack. A Team Leader on Nights was the only one I respected but he's gone. Shame as now he has gone we have no one who takes us seriously, or treats us with dignity. Poor employer to work for."

We were the special advisors. My country team consisted of 3 people. One colleague was always listened to but us other 2 we were treated very special-. Throughout the whole team information was given only to the people who were good with the manager. we had 2 swaps within one year- the first leader really convinced me to speak about  if i would have a problem with my colleague. i said no cause I think these things need to resolve themselves -but he asked me in every one to one about it so that i thought he is interested and then I said what i do not like. Then the whole thing started. it broke up our team- instead of resolving it was always belived this one apparently only one knowledgeable member of the team and I feel betrayed for having said anything. Kept quiet went on working, Teamleader swap - became worse- the whole situation evolved again and that special person in our team got attention and everything and even in meetings with i higher perosn from the department the problem was not solved!

Also in my reviews silly excuses were found that I do not reach the WELL DONE you need in order to be acknowledged or move to a different department whcih was my goal. I was not well done because I did a gap between a hiven and a capital letter and stuff like like this . I was always punctual or even over punctual at ASOS but even that meant nothing. The special person could be late 4 times a week ( yes we started counting and noted stuff) and they had always more cigarette breaks than others. Even behaving acc to the rules the next comment in my review was: You are better but still not welll done. No comment why on how instead poking on being sick one day! Was really not fair- felt useless with my colleague after a while and why they need us if the other person is so GREAT! This person btw was reluctant to show us stuff and always with a sigh and when I complained about it.they made a fuss !

ASOS,9/5/2016, ,Current Employee,,4,,,,,,,o,o,o,Great company with growing pains...,"I work on the IT side of things which I believe has matured and developed greatly over the last 18 months or so. ASOS is growing it's internal capabilities and investing in its people which is always nice to see.

The people are great - almost everyone is extremely competent and has a collaborative, can-do attitude. The social side of things is also quite impressive.

I find the work varied and interesting - there is opportunity to grow and move teams (Not everyday obviously! But if you are keen to be involved in something else they will make every effort to accommodate you)
 
Location is good - Camden for food, pubs and shops. Regents park for lunch time walk / run. Tube and bus stops directly outside of the office.

The whole place buzzes and feels like an organisation on the up - which is great!","Asos has been growing rapidly for the last few years and the London office is starting to run out of space - they have plans to address this, but they're a few months away at best so things are a bit cramped at the moment.

The business can be a bit woolly in what it wants to achieve - there is clarity from the exec board about their vision, but it gets a bit muddled at the next layer down when it comes to implementing that strategy. They get there eventually but possibly not in the most efficient way. There are signs that the new CEO recognizes this and is making some people changes

Food - Some people rave about the canteen and its food, I find it often to be overly complex and 'lah-di-dah' for the money. Still you're only 5 mins walk from a whole bunch of great places to eat or buy a sandwich so ..."

If you want to work in a company where you want to progress DO NOT apply for ASOS as 90% off the Team Leaders have come from other companies and have not been a Customer Care Advisor before. They watch everything you do like Big Brother there will give you stupid one to one meeting which is completely pointless and irrelevant. They FORCE you to call customers even though you have told them you ain’t comfortable doing them as you not familiar with all the processes yet, when in actual fact it’s the Team Leaders job to do it. When a member of staff has been sacked or had there probation extended everyone knows about it. The Team Leader I had was a BULLY he use to shout at us when we are not hitting our targets we couldn’t even book a holiday with out being questioned he wants to know why we are taking the holiday and we have to ask him for a holiday even though it has been authorised already. Also was told to kiss the top managers bum to keep my job.

- Shuttle bus runs every 1hour
- Warehouse is 10 - 15 mins drive from Watford Junction. If you drive thats perfect, or else catch an Uber every morning into work. Buses and trains do not pass the Asos Warehouse, so your f'd either way.

Work
- Your responsibility is to respond to customer emails for 7.5 hours. Thats it!!
- If is tedious and unfulfilling 

Management
- Team leaders, and other supervisors are for the most part okay. 
- They are young and inexperienced, lack knowledge and awareness of self and everything else in life. So do not expect them to be in position to help. 
- Help yourself fool!

Environment
- The atmosphere and energy of the place seemed okay, but when you really look at the situation regarding the location of the job, the work you are doing, the petty games management play, everyone looks like they are slowly dying inside. Nobody really seems fulfilled in their job. No one is happy. No one is having a good time. In fact, people are waiting for the end of the day.

Mid level management is very volatile and cliquey. If you do well, the manager will make your achievement as their own (and sometimes credit you for it). Do poorly, and the finger will definitely be pointed at you, you will be micromanaged and you will be reprimanded. If you want to progress in your career you will have to belong to the clique which is a boys club.

It was only when I resigned that they decided to listen but even then my complaint was never taken seriously. The HR department are completely for the company and are not too concerned with the wellbeing of the individual employee. The management I was under are entirely inexperienced, socially inept and unprofessional. They are allowed to abuse their position of authority without being challenged. I'm sure many of my previous employees would agree that it is more like being back at school rather than in a professional working environment. I have heard more recently that people have had mental breakdowns working here, and I was on the verge. Don't be fooled by the amazing benefits and working culture, believe me, it's not worth it!

It was that my behavior did not suit the requirements of the role customer care advisor and that it is not acceptable to say things like 'Thanks Mate' or  'cheers bro' to the Team Leader. There was no statements taken from either side or any investigation concluded, it was just taken as fact that I must've said it. Even though I did not know this until I was in the meeting my employment was being terminated in.

All I can say is, if they don't like you personally then they will do whatever they need to, to get rid of you. Even if that means making things up likemy leader did. They also have a negative snappy attitude towards workers but this is more due to the type of Leaders that were training my group at the time, the others seemed fine.

Company is always looking forward and trying to evolve","On retail it really is just luck of the draw on what team you get put on which determines what kind of experience you will have and whether you will get promoted.  Because it's so big, it's impossible for each team to provide the same atmosphere, culture and experience as the managers vary WILDLY and are not being reviewed on their behaviour.  I moved teams three times within retail and each were like a COMPLETELY different job.  One team I was bullied by my manger and another senior member of the team spoke to HR about it as they were concerned and nothing was done.  On my other team my manager was an absolute dream and I loved it.  I've seen more than 10 incidents of people speaking to HR about people on my dpt (the same two people) and all that happened was eventually the people that complained left and the people being complained about got promoted.
I really struggle to see what HR do and how effective they are at dealing with this sort of thing because it is happening a lot and it's such a shame because it's really letting down the rep of the company; the horrible people in management positions who seemed to have slipped through the net when it comes to kind and professional behaviour just because they are good at what they do.

As a result there is a monolithic tech presence organised around platforms not customer needs, preferring to take a shopping list of features than explore an ambiguous space and test and learn their way to creating true customer value. 

In many ways this is a corporate IT structure from 2005. 

The organisation remains heavily  siloed and the suggestion of cross functional teams working towards a metric-focussed outcome is treated with suspicion by tech leadership. One suspects because it threatens their power base. 

There is a strategic vacuum at the top, meaning everyone decides what they think is important. This changes on a weekly basis as plans go out the window to chase short term wins.

They also keep creating new teams that absolutely make no sense.

As a company, they’ll go to any length to protect their precious public reputation and to scaremonger their employees to avoid word being spread of the evil and vindictive work culture that goes on behind the scenes in their offices.

When you start your job with them, you’ll be sold a dream of an employer that values their staff, drives personal development, as well offering great benefits e.g. staff discount, free onsite gym membership, monthly free alcoholic beverages on shift etc (which you’ll end up relying on, to help you cope with their diabolical management), but it doesn’t take long before the cracks begin to show in their cleverly executed facade. 

You’ll have their company values to be “Authentic, Brave and Creative” drilled into you from the get-go, yet you’ll find yourself penalised and labeled as a troublemaker if they don’t like what you have to say. 

Progression and promotion opportunities aren’t rewarded to the loyal and hardworking employees, instead, they’re given to those individuals that spend all of their time gossiping with and sucking up to Team Leaders on company time, rather than doing the work they’re being paid to do. 

Passion and dedication to your role go unnoticed, but they’ll be quick to reprimand you for getting up from your desk to grab a glass of water, being a few minutes late back from your break or lunch or god forbid being off sick when you are unwell. This results in extremely high staff turnover and leaves people feeling deflated and unworthy. The number of staff absences related to mental health issues triggered by the workplace is at an all-time high. 

In July 2018, ASOS signed the Time to Change pledge, stating they are “committed to supporting those with mental health conditions without judgement” and yet on returning to work, you are asked patronising questions in a formal documented interview, designed to make you feel guilty and ashamed, such as “Do you understand the impact your absence had on the business?”, which sounds extremely judgement if you ask me. 

If the management at ASOS had an ounce of compassion for their employees, they’d realise that they are not robots, so they shouldn’t be treated like one. It’s about time that they open their eyes and use their ears to start actually listening to the feedback of their staff and addressing the serious flaws within their working culture before it’s too late."

ASOS,26/6/2019, Associate IOS Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 3 years","London, England, England",4,5,4,,2,2,3,x,x,x,"Great people, no money","Friendliest, most talented people I’ve ever worked with. Increasingly more flexible remote working options.","Salary is way below market rate, and the way promotions work resemble a popularity contest."
ASOS,26/6/2019, Senior II Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","Birmingham, England, England",5,5,5,,5,5,5,v,v,r,One of the best employers and best offices (Birmingham) I've ever had the pleasure of working,"This place raises the bar and some, it has the highest technical excellence of anywhere I've ever worked and has some of the most clever, competent people I've ever worked alongside.  There's definitely a lot to learn and people to learn from.  

You'll get experience developing cloud-based solutions that are resilient, high performing and scalable, all the while implemented using leading software engineering practices such as ATDD, BDD, TDD and Pair Programming.

ASOS offers a fantastic package with flexible working in a relaxed atmosphere where you can truly be yourself.

Since the bar is raised so high here, when the time comes and you move on you'll find it quite an adjustment having to work anywhere else. This is a compliment to the Birmingham office.  Many people who end their journey at ASOS move on into very senior positions due to the valuable skills and experience gained here.","Once you've 'learned the ropes' the work isn't challenging, most of the hard problems have already been solved and much of the work is boiler plate rinse and repeat.  If you're looking for pure software development then you may be disappointed, the software engineer role is more DevOps so much of the job is scripting and managing configuration where much of the job is spent in a web browser battling the tooling (although there are initiatives to solve this long term).

Not all the work is greenfield, much of the system is still in 'legacy' and thus you'll be dealing with horrible big balls of mud, but this is part and parcel of most companies.  They are very slowly trying to migrate to cloud based solutions but this process will take several years."
ASOS,26/6/2019, Warehouse Operative,Current Employee,"Grimethorpe, England, England",3,3,3,,4,4,4,x,r,r,Large warehouse to work in. However behaviour of some contracted employees and agency workers is far below expectations.,ASAP job opportunities.Large chances for a start especially over summer.,Overcrowded workplace where often some people are bringing their personal feelings and willing to deal with arguments from outside inside of a workplace.
ASOS,1/7/2019, Assistant Garment Technologist,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","London, England, England",3,2,2,,2,3,2,x,x,x,Not a good time to be a garment tech at ASOS,"Discount, amazing sample sales, some amazing people, great food in canteen, (although over-priced) good amount of holiday days, great place to learn, amazing educational aspects from The Academy","There are so many changes happening at ASOS that its hard to keep up. Director has very little knowledge of the business, very little knowledge of what garment technology at ASOS entails, is very impersonal and extremely demotivating. They has made so many changes to GT that it is no longer representative of garment technology as a whole - it seems as though GT is being phased out all together. They've made so many wrong decisions and has limited progression and removed so many processes that during their time there, we've lost over half of the original garment tech team and they are not back-filling either, meaning that workload is pilling up and techs are being signed off with stress (all of which management/HR doesn't seem to care about- no support is offered) There is not a single member of garment technology which is happy in their job. 
There is little to no training given when you start - I was being trained up by other assistants who had started not long before I had. 
ASOS as a whole are struggling massively, morale is absolutely terrible as more and more perks are slowly being removed. Redundancies are being made left, right and centre  and its very common to be walking through corridors/go to the toilets/walk around the canteen and see someone crying. 
When I started almost 2 years ago, ASOS was a happy and exciting place to work, however have fallen onto hard times but has become very corporate (something they promised wouldn't happen) in that time, causing a lot of anger and frustration with current employees. 
It's a very hard time to be working in the Retail part of ASOS due to cutting headcount and upping the option count, meaning that there is too much work to keep up with, too much for the amount of people they have. 
I also have suspicion that many Glassdoor reviews which are popping up are fake. 

It is hard to list every bad aspect of GT currently so the best way to describe it is: Garment Technology is an amazing, fun and creative profession to have, however, ASOS is not the place to practice that profession right now. Times used to be different but as long as they have the vision which is currently being rolled out, you will not be respected or be happy as a garment tech there. Perhaps in a few years, things may improve, but right now, I wouldn't bother - for your own happiness, mental health and career."
ASOS,1/7/2019, Web Engineer,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England, England",2,4,2,,2,3,2,x,v,r,A free-falling venture,"At this point the company perks are the main reason to enjoy work: the building is great, the canteen serves delicious food for cheap, the ASOS discount...","The promotion scheme is deceiving: you can nail your objectives and it doesn't guarantee you a promotion whatsoever; ""well done, maybe next year"". The web team is crippled with managers and technical figures that are long past their prime. Product teams, design teams and development teams work in silos, making the everyday completely uninspiring."

Definitely makes up for a good environment.",A lot of micromanagement that is very unnecessary. Proper 9 to 5:30 clock in and out that feels very outdated.
ASOS,4/7/2019, Customer Care Advisor,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","Durham, NC",1,1,1,,1,1,1,x,x,x,"An awful company to work for. Absolutely nothing 'authentic, brave or creative about working there.",The canteen had good food options.,"Pay is awful considering how much the company makes. Not a realistic liveable wage at all. The work although very routine can be really stressful at times so wasn't worth the wage, there's many other contact centres that offer similar work at a higher rate of pay. 

Advisers are treated like children and there monitoring system gets very tiresome, everything you do is logged and god help your one minute late from break/ lunch as this gets brought up and is the kind of stuff that will stop you getting a bonus. (Not that there was one anyway).

Shift patterns can make it hard to plan for doing things outside work. The way the shift are set out (starting one week at 6.30am, then next week working till 8.30pm) will really screw with your sleeping patten so prepare to feel exhausted. 

Booking Holiday (especially around summer and Christmas) was an absolute nightmare. Weekends become unavailable to book off months in advance so forget last minute holidays/ getaways or plans in general.

You'll be told that there's fantastic progression opportunity's, however many of the other 'specialist teams' don't actually pay anymore than being a core adviser. The teams that do pay more are still very poor compared to a lot of other companies.

Although the job role is described as 'Customer Care Adviser' you'll be expected to work duties for other teams with no extra pay, or even a say.  Not even an email to notify you you'll be doing different work which can be very stressful. 

General communication from management to advisors and other teams is pretty much non existent/ poor. Process changes within the office we're sometimes just heard from word of mouth with no explanation. 

Many of the 'perks' of working for ASOS completely disappeared the longer I was there. The end of year bonus got scrapped, Friday drinks stopped, the free fruit was taken away. Shift swaps we're no longer allowed and one of the shuttle bus routes stopped completely. It seemed the company was trying to save money by cutting benefits for the staff paid the least. 

Parking at the office (especially on later shifts) was sometimes very hard. It seemed they had hired way more staff than the car park can facilitate. Cars we're routinely getting hit and scratched with no investigation. 

The turnaround of staff at this contact centre is massive, people we're coming and going every week and with all the points I've stated above isn't a surprise at all. My final advise if your considering working at this contact centre - don't."

Personally, being allowed to manage my team to success with autonomy. 

Some decent members of management to collaborate with - but this is extremely rare (see below).

Work/life balance is good.

Decent benefits.","Reaction and change - working in a fast paced and changing environment is to be expected in any growing company but ASOS tried too quickly to grow itself. A 'chuck money at problems' attitude.

No confidence when collaborating with other members of the team leader community due to lack of management by their manager or experience.

Nepotism is rife within customer care and most 'support' teams are made up of friends who've been given free reign to offer roles to those who have zero experience.

Development opportunities are more of a popularity contest than of deserved applications - which shows in the recent cull of people at management level. There has been a restructure due to business issues which has seen over a hundred people made redundant due to bad business decisions made the last few years.

No-one ever really seems to be pulling in the same direction - too many members of management have difference of knowledge but not in a positive way (this is down to too many senior management only having knowledge of ASOS as a business - which is an issue since the customer care department has grown).

Very specific, but the term 'perception is reality' being used by high level management as a way of judging people's ways of working or personalities within their roles. This is frightening considering the amount of people that work within customer care.

Rumours, bitchiness and college-like feel about the place is the absolute worst. It is like being back at school (that's just the management).

- Poor systems - well at least in my role, you will have to do everything on massive excel sheets which are on the verge of crashing your computer down any moment. Asos needs some investment in retail systems
- regular emerging last minute deadlines that could easily be planned into the critical path - emails are frequently sent with deadlines due in shorter time than it takes on average to complete the task causing a frenzy which breaks down the document that needs to be filled in
- poor attitude to mental health - management haven't been trained adequately on dealing with employees whose mental health is worsening and the risk it poses to Asos.  For example when a manager was told that someone on their team is suffering from poor mental health because of things going on Asos they privately berated them for not having what it takes to work at the company and excluded them for being up for any promotional opportunities."

ASOS,17/4/2020, Established Buying Administrator,Former Employee,"London, England, England",1,1,1,,1,4,1,x,r,r,Don’t be fooled by the fancy head office - ASOS care way more for profits than people,Cool head office. Discount on ASOS items.,"Extremely fake, gossipy environment, a lot of bullying going on. Buyers get away with anything they want, come in late all the time, talk to you as rude as they like. It’s one rule for them, another for you. You could be late a few times in one week and and they’ll pull you for a chat. But don’t even think about mentioning they’re late nearly every day. Don’t complain to anyone above them either, or ask to move teams as you’ll get fired, they are all close. HR do nothing to help or support you but team up, and make up a scenario with these people to get you fired. They wont even follow the correct disciplinary procedure, even when you have passed probation. I was the most hard working person on my team staying until 8pm most days, but it was never appreciated. When they fire you they will say you stayed late because you came in late, to try and make themselves look better, when you was hardly late at all. 

Do not even think about showing an interest in a different area of the business, like they promote to you at interview. They will fire you for not having passion for your role. I tried to network and ask current employees how to get experience for the role and was told that was wrong, even when the replies were helpful. I asked the interviewer for advice on how to get experience after not getting a role and I was repeatedly ignored when all I showed was extreme passion. This will also get you fired because they will complain it made them feel uncomfortable. They wont just reply to you like a normal human being would, and put you at ease, that’s clearly too much for them to do as a manager.

When you’re getting dismissed they will list extremely pathetic reasons to make it look more legitimate. Even things that happened before you were at ASOS, because their source on information doesn’t know all the facts. Never trust anyone, when they want you gone, they will use everything against you. I don’t know how ASOS get away with treating employees the way they do. Don’t even think about telling HR or your head that your job is affecting your mental health, you will also get fired within days, when they make up an excuse as to why. ASOS make out they care about mental health awareness, they are liars. 

You are overworked here, and stressed out, it can take 2+ years to progress to a more senior position as everyone is very clicky. People above you will give you work way above your level because they’re too lazy to do it themselves but say it is for your progression. A lot of employees in buying do not last, as no one genuinely cares about you. Take my advice and DO NOT WORK HERE."

They were not geared up to welcome new starters and I waited 8 weeks for the systems access in order to do my job properly. I then waited a further 4 weeks for my line manager to hand over jobs to me because they are the worst micro managers and don’t know how to delegate or manage their time. On top of that the blame culture within ASOS is the worst I have ever experienced, no one is accountable for anything with a lot of people looking to hide mistakes, blame someone else and talk down to you. I have spent the last 5 months being gaslighted by my boss who is incompetent and thrives off making people feel bad about themselves. The systems at ASOS are not fit for purpose and you spend 80% of your time waiting for reports to run/information to come back and even then you have to run 3 reports because the reporting system can’t handle the amount of lines you’re reporting on. The whole set up is a waste of people’s time and skills. I am fortunate enough to have never suffered from my mental health prior to working here but the way I have been treated at ASOS means I have suffered from the worst anxiety and panic attacks ever. There hasn’t been a day I haven’t cried or been treated poorly and the job isn’t worth it, the workload and the pay is the worst. Don’t put yourself through it. They email on sundays and at 9pm + and it is not conducive to good work life balance or a happy lifeX"

Beauty bar downstairs 
Nice working in London
Season ticket loan for travel","Where do I even begin with this? We were overworked and underpaid, expected to work long hours (particularly on Monday when the systems would crash as you tried to do anything). If you left on time you’d be on the receiving end of tuts and snarky comments.

There was absolutely no chance for progression. I made it clear during my interview that was what I was looking for in this job and was promised the world but what I found instead was tasks being dropped on you from a higher level under the guise of progression, only to receive no assistance and when you (inevitably) fail you’d be blasted in front of the whole team. You’d also be expected to cover colleagues work when on holiday which on its own is not a unfair request but on multiple occasions I had to pick up a colleagues task they had left for days only to be told off and when I couldn’t cover my workload, their workload, helping to train a new person and the task they’d just left prior to their holiday - somehow myself not being able to cover this was my issue and not the issue of the person on holiday.

This brings us to the biggest issue I found at ASOS the workplace bullying. I loathe to call someone this but my manager was nothing more than a bully protected by the managers above them. Once they had decided they had it out for me my time was done and I was bullied to the point of a mental breakdown, and pulled into a meeting where I felt I had no choice to quit or be fired. In a last ditch attempt I went to HR only to have them feed back to my bully’s manager who in turn pulled me to one side and brought up the comments I had made. So much for confidentially. In the end I felt like I had to rescind my comments in my exit interview for fear of my reference being in danger.

I struggle to bring anything new to the table as you have to please so many people to have it progress and fight against other priorities.
In the IT department there's hardly any HR process; we don't have any decent objectives or proper performance reviews. The compliance training within IT (not the training for everyone) is not very well thoughts out and feels like a waste of time.
There is a lack of recognition for good work.
In software engineering there is no room for progression unless you want to become a manager as there is no junior or senior roles.

The future is out there and AXA is beginning to do some really good things in this space. Positive disruption is key and there is a renewed vibe going on. It is exciting and if you like a challenge where you can participate and drive... I've had a number of roles over the years and my latest role is the most challenging but the most rewarding. I have felt I have had a direct influence on the business by improving the engagement and culture.,"Not everyone likes to get involved, let alone drive in an area of change. Previously it was a comfortable company. People are beginning to find this is not possible anymore, so it might not be for you if you want a quiet life.

 AXA has dealt with the current situation in an excellent way instead of choosing ""the easy way"" AXA empowered and trusted its people by offering WFH, flexibility and support.

 I personally love my job and I am proud to be working for AXA.I would definitely recommend it.","Being a big company there are a lot of politics and sometimes progression at the lower levels is achieved thanks to favouritism rather than talent and its very difficult to develop if you are not in the right ""circle"" .

I have never worked in a friendlier, more productive place. The whole ethos is about employee engagement, empowered productivity, trust and fun.

There are regular social events for the whole company provided by the company. These are usually incredibly well attended, enjoyable and fantastic networking opportunities.

Every quarter there is a state of the nation address from the executive board to the entirety of Abcam, this ensures that everyone is on the same page, aware of what's going on and engaged with KPIs.

The company trusts its employees implicitly and this is rewarded tenfold. The access to the computers, product data, the database and home working are all virtually unrestricted and provides very little in the way of IT system bureaucracy and barriers to productivity.

Especially now the Cambridge, UK headquarters has moved to the Biomedical Campus at Addenbrooks…the work environment looks and feels much more professional and modern.
A purpose-driven company; with the desire to save lives through medical research.  Whilst that doesn’t necessary show up in every meeting, it does determine the type of people they hire and work with.  Everyone is here to do good work and make a difference, without too much ego.
Very friendly, real, relaxed, yet hard working/fast-paced culture.
A conversation-driven management culture; whereby employees and mangers are encouraged to talk through issues together, rather than email/escalate/document.
A great new office space in Cambridge; lots of non-bookable meeting spaces, some stand-up desks, a fully hot desking environment with personal lockers, showers, towel hire, drying room etc.
Free (good quality) barista coffee & a forward-thinking café with healthy options; menu changes daily.
Currently a VERY attractive share scheme available for all employees.
Dress code is essentially just come as yourself, which means there’s much less bravado/show than other corporates.","As I understand, Cambridge council want to reduce the number of cars in the city, so Abcam were only allowed a limited car park size for the new building.  This means you don’t get a car parking space every day.  Most people park in one of the park & rides then walk/cycle to work.  
Whilst the Senior Management are far better than most I’ve seen, there are still behaviours that permeate the culture.  They are an ambitious team but that leads to a lot of pressure to deliver magic results.  When things don’t go their way, there is a tendency to blame, rather than take ownership as a leadership team.  It is often up to one or two leaders to shelve the blame, rather than the senior team pulling together.  
The top team can be too quick to judge someone from hero to zero."

All of the exec leadership team are incredibly approachable, and so are the functional leaders and managers. There is no feeling of hierarchy or that you can't say what you really think in meetings or at lunch or wherever. In fact peoples' opinions are genuinely welcomed and if people have a different opinion there is a culture of discussing it from both perspectives. It's very refreshing.

So far in my first 3 months I've not seen any cross-functional fighting; everyone is very used to discussing challenges in an open way - maybe because there are lots of scientists there is a very collaborative vibe. 

I also like the way employees are treated as people; there are lots of extra-curricular activities and adhoc groups you can join.

Some of the people were great to work with.  The company makes you think that you are important by laying on lots of good events.  Make use of the training opportunities.,Long hours and weekend working is the norm. Not family friendly.  Don't think you will ever been home for bedtime if you have young children.

I relish this kind of variety because I get bored very easily.","As much as Accenture say that they don't pigeon hole people I have not found this to be true, HR take very little interest (or have a complete lack of understanding) of people skills and as a consequence you could end up in a completely unsuitable workforce.  Accenture is the type of place however that if you network with the right people and are not afraid to pick up the phone to a senior partner and ask him for a favor you can get moved to where you want to be within the firm and start to really enjoy it.  I would recommend anyone who joins Accenture to think of themselves as self employed, treat every other Accenture employee as a potential customer, and network your backside off - if you don't do this you will get no where in this firm.  You are not given a support network you have to create one for yourself. That said, this does has the effect of breeding some pretty useful business qualities within our staff.  Experienced hires will suffer, especially if they have come from a none consulting background as I did, normally the suffering lasts about a year and you either quit or start to fit in.  Do not expect to get a good rating in your first year as an experienced hire, you'll definitely find that there's a old boy network to the rating system on many projects, so you’ll need to develop relationships with the big hitters in your laddering session to get by.  Everyone plays the laddering game."
Accenture,21/8/2008, Senior Manager,Former Employee,"London, England, England",4,3,,,4,4,4,v,v,o,Great place if you are ambitious and like working hard,"Accenture is a great place to learn about delivery. This is what Accenture does best, delivering tough projects to tight timescales. It is a very hard-working place and people are expected to contribute - Accenture is not a place to ""cruise"" and tolerance of failure is low. Knowledge sharing is good within the Company, and there is good cooperation between different offices where this is required to serve clients.","At Accenture it is all about commitment to the client (and the consequent growth of Accenture itself). This can put great strains on the individual worker and there is an unspoken (sometimes spoken!) assumption that 'the job comes first'. The reason people tolerate this is the significant rewards for those who make it to partner (now ""Senior Executive""), and the reasonable expectation that ex-Accenture staff are valued in the market place"

Generally you feel that your are working with bright capable people and that nothing is impossible.","Long hours, unsociable hours, constant weekends. Forget your family. From the late 90s until around 2002, the salary and package was unbeatable in the UK along with the 10k GBP golden hello. Since then its been steadily trimmed back and the salaries and benefits are now quite unremarkable. There was a pay freeze for many in consulting in 2006. At the same time profits and share price have continued to steam ahead, leaving many employees feeling short-changed. There is a feeling that they have gone downmarket in order to compete on price with other consulting firms and the Indian outsourcers, so in terms of working with the smartest people in the business...its not what it used to be as salaries have gone down, so have the quality of the recruits they manage to hang onto. The best people are leaving in droves to become freelancers and earn a good daily rate."
Accenture,22/8/2008, Management Consulting Senior Manager,Former Employee,"London, England, England",4,4,,,4,3,5,v,v,o,Accenture - outstanding opportunities if you have the strength and tenacity to succeed,"To Accenture employees ""the firm"" is both employer and an effective career development resource. Accentures community of like-minded, professional and genuinely capable individuals creates the perfect environment for honing the raw skills of graduates and trainees into successful, capable leaders of tomorrow. For career growth and structured professional training Accenure is at the top of the global league of  career employers.  The focussed culture enables it to nurture world-class consultants - the skill and capability of individuals who make it through to the senior management and executive level is invariably outstanding.  The work is varied and rarely uninteresting - often encompassing technologies and techniques at the forefront of innovation. Accenture presents opportunities for career advancement and personal development at every turn. If you have the raw skill, determination and confidence to get out there and work hard, the opportunities are fantastic.","As with all consulting firms the pressure to out-perform a strong group of peers and progress through the ranks is intense and unrelenting. Coupled with the old consulting dilemma of balancing client expectation with the need to run the firm itself can result in little time for a personal life.  Accenture's culture is often high-pressure, all-or-nothing, death-or-glory hard.  If you are the kind of individual who responds well in a competitive, agressive environment Accenture can drive you to achieve great things, beyond what you thought yourself capable of.  If not you're likely to leave broken."

If you join the Solutions workforce, less is expected of you, but the pay and respect you receive are also less.","Accenture has a 'caste system' with the Consulting workforce at the top of the tree, and Solutions and Services workforces somewhere further down.  Given that Consulting people often work closely with Solutions and Service people, frequently doing exactly the same work, the caste system can result in low morale for people in Solutions/Services who feel undervalued."

Accenture,26/8/2008, Systems Integration Consultant,Current Employee,"London, England, England",3,2,,,4,2,3,o,r,o,Kick starts your career - but dominates your life,"* Strong career development structure for new graduate
* Great colleagues who are supportive and sharing
* Variety of large blue-chip FTSE 100 companies to work with
* Responsibility delegated at early stage in career
* Potential to travel - depending on nature of project","* Long hours (up to 50+)

* No overtime pay

* Performance Reviews are geared towards rewarding those with most 'time at level' - a 1 year old high performing consultant will rarely be rewarded over a 3 year old average performing consultant

* HR has little concept of realities of work and needs of project - from both a project and individual perspective they are only interested in filling positions and keeping unassigned numbers low regardless of individual skills

* HR known to show favourtism to those they are friendly with

* Training is available but no clear instruction on how to apply and recieve approval for it

* Long, unreasonable commutes - I've never had a commute less than 90 minutes (and I live in central London!) - management typically put client first and bend over backwards to satisfy with little regard for consequences to their own team

* Management support can vary depending on project and manager - I've had great constructive feedback from one manager, but then from another I'm seen as a junior resource who should just get the job done and not ask questions or request opportunities to develop skillbase beyond role description.

* Accenture's recruitment policy and business needs don't always seem to align - they recruited heavily at the start of 2007 and now are struggling to find roles for everyone - ultimately the employee suffers as work is being generated where it doesn't exist (I was recently told I had to recruit a new analyst regardless of requirements)

* HR recruitment is seemingly outsourced and disconnected with existing pay structure - last year it was announced the starting salary for an analyst would be raised by £2k, meanwhile new analysts who started up to 6 months before this remained on the old starting salary. And those in the company for a year or more were now being paid the same as a new analyst....when pushed to justify this the analyst group lead said it was just the way it was and we had to accept it or leave (!)

* New Analyst Consulting Group (ACG) created in the UK is hopeless and does not help in accurate assignment to projects - whereas before analysts were assigned to an industry group (Finance, Resources, Products etc.) now they are all pooled together as one. Projects do not have visibility of analyst experience (which an industry alignment would provide), and leadership of the ACG is condecending to the point that analysts are treated as adolescent teenagers!

* ACG structure was intended to allow analysts to move freely between industries and learn more of Accenture work. But this does not align with how Accenture works in realty where career progression is based on who you know and responsibilities built on a single project. As an analyst I worked on 2 projects over 24 months. My first consistently promised great rewards in return for loyalty and after 16 months I got none. 8 months on my second project luckily secured me a promotion that I would have otherwise not received. The ACG seems to think that 6 months or less on a project will be suffice for an analyst to build contacts and credibility required to succeed to consultant within the 2 year training period."

There are two section ATS and Consulting senior management is always from consulting.,"work life balance is only on projects that have an agreement with the client of paying by the day not by the hour. In that case, what happens is that managers push for ""work life balance"" which means you go home at normal time and then work will have to be done in more days. Other projects are standard consulting /IBANking long hours. In addition, when you are trying to find a project you are looking for a job again. You have to send ppl resumes. Managers won't call you back unless there is something in it for them. The scheduling team has no clue whats going on. You get given projects which you have to take on as a graduate software engineer and then if you have done testing you get type cast in testing. Then if you go for a development role, the managers or TL from accenture will say you don't have developement experience !!! after a year. ! A friend of mine who had done a masters in electronics worked for months as an admin on project for senior managers. He was hired as a Software Engineer.

There is a risk of getting lost in the crowd if you don't work for the right group of people and you don't pay attention to the ""politics"" of relations.

The remuneration is pretty good - I used to say 'it's good, but it's not banking', but it seems like a more stable place to be since the global financial crisis led to the end of ridiculous city bonuses.  A diverse range of interesting clients and interesting projects is another huge plus point.","As with any consulting firm, there are high expectations which go with the level of responsibility you are granted.  The focus on delivery means that there are times when excessively long hours are required - however in my view the culture of constant long hours is dying.  There is an expectation that managers will plan projects on the basis that people work normal hours, and despite peaks and troughs in activity, if the hours are consistently long then it reflects badly on the manager.  There is also a lot of travel, sometimes to great places and sometimes to the middle of nowhere."
Accenture,9/4/2009, Systems Analyst,Former Employee,"London, England, England",2,2,,,2,4,1,x,r,o,"Nice company, acceptable pay, but competing internal workforces causes friction between employees and departments.","Nice payment package, compensation, being able to work in different sectors, some travel. The use of an Amex card is quite handy as well if you havent got one. Being able to think and work out of the box, working for other clients. Great training and benefits packages being given.","Competing workforces i.e consultants v solutions, Dog eat dog culture, survival for the fittest. Back biting from executives, being placed in projects and working alongside people that are expected to be made redundant when the solution that you are introducing replaces their jobs. Training allowances are given, but sometimes you dont get to use it."

It looks great on the CV and the pay is normally pretty good, although this can vary depending on whether you get a duff review.","No work - life balance.  They expect you to earn your money, so you'll spend an awful lot of time at the office and probably a lot of time away from home.  The laddering system used for performance ratings can be very hit and miss.  You can find yourself getting a good ratings for not doing a great deal one minute and then very average ratings for working your arse off the next - depending on the project you're on.  For promotions there is a real emphasis on time at level as opposed to whether people are actually any good or not.  I've seen people who are extremely average get promoted ahead of others that are much better but haven't yet served their ""time"".  At the more senior levels the Senior Execs can start treating you like a dormat."

Solutions people get little recognition for their experience and are usually put in at a lower grade than they would otherwise in industry. Further to this promotion is unfair in structure. e.g. a Senior Consultant in Consulting is eligible for promotion after 1 year, in Solutions a Senior Systems Analyst must wait 2 years. Further cons are the promotion process itself, its all about getting your friends on side to puch you through and it doesnt really matter at all what your actual ability and perfomance was.

The people you work with on the Consulting side are passionate, intelligent, dedicated and hard working. The pay is fantastic. The company perks are great - expense card, hotels, apartments, training but beware the glamour that hides the dark side.

Ridiculous laddering system for promotions. High leve of travel expected and a frustrating way the company is orgnised sometimes means that you get 1 person travelling from London to Newcastle every week and another person travelling from Newcastle to London every week.

Accenture,31/10/2010, Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,"London, England, England",2,2,,,2,3,3,x,r,o,Working for Accenture,"The work at Accenture ideally prepares a fresh-faced graduate to get some *real* experience with some of the Big names in the Industry - which certainly looks good on a  CV. The work you do is actual contracted work that a client has paid good money for - so unlike some in-house software projects, there is an implicit guarantee that your work will be used.

The culture to outperform your peers contributes as a key motivator to constantly evaluate oneself and be more retrospective as to how one can improve and be more valuable to the company - as this translates to the performance appraisal, promotion and rewards scheme. So. complacency is not something that is given much encouragement (which is another good thing).

You get to work with some senior people who have to deliver and add value to the customers requirements. So, with this kind of pressure, those whom you work with give you an insight as to how to plan, structure and deliver value to the client - without compromising on quality

There are some renowned experts - either technical or business minded. From a technical perspective, you get to see how some experts make technical and architectural decisions - which form a valuable learning experience.","Contrary to the published website literature, project managers always have the right to override HR policies.

Business requirements and promotion eligibility criteria fluctuate - and is hard to ascertain what exactly guarantees a promotion; you can do everything that is needed, and still not get it - as there was no business need to increase the level of promotees at the next level.

Long working hours is almost standard. Very few projects have a 9-5 working schedule."

Good structured methodology & training.
Good set of work-related online tools.
Great for younger people with a travel bug.
Great mixture of roles across the lifecycle (rather than static/easily stereotyped in a traditional employer).
Can work anywhere with good online, single sign-on connectivity to most systems.
Can either be a generic consultant or a specialist (though can be difficult to swap between the two).
Good pension management & contributions.","Having to often live out of a suitcase for long periods of time, away from home Mon-Fri.
Often having little choice as to which client and where you work next (and for how long).
Being thrown in deep end often (is also a pro at times but not when happens all the time), which can put you in a difficult position with your high day rate & clients expecting specialists.
**Although appraisal/promotional laddering uses many metrics & checks-and-balances, it still fundamentally comes down to who is representing you and how much presence they have in meetings (and ""squeaky wheel"" people who get recognition/promoted).
**Often long hours and maybe doing 2-3 people's jobs => high stress.
**Could be so much quicker/easier if people knew advanced MS Office as this toolset used 98% of time; many just don't know how to do basics of structured information for others' consumption, let alone to process it in a repeatable, automated way.
Internal role board can make company seem like a glorified recruitment agency.
**Too much hands-on IT dev/test work is off-shore, meaning that it's now hard for new recruits to get experience & creating an on-shore skills gap (& gradually making off-shore resources more valuable & expensive).
""Jack of all trades, master of none"" can make it hard when leaving Accenture in current market to get a role in an end-client (not so much another consultancy) who want ""extensive experience"" in something niche or other."

- Work/life balance is not too bad when staffed on a large project. Smaller short term projects are a different story
- Excellent place to build a network in the industry","- Compensation has been the hot topic for years now. Accenture does pay less than its competitors and the move to a plc effectively took away the carrot for becoming an SE, which results in typically less pay with the promise of more in a far away future
- Promotions and laddering processes are incredibly subjective. It is about who you know and not what you do. Accenture will always claim it is fair yet most people know it is not. Having seen the process from both sides it is quite disfunctional
- With sales targets becoming more and more important, emphasis is on selling and not delivery. This results in over promising clients what really can be achieved, to the point of inventing offerings Accenture does not have. When the delivery team comes in (and the sales have been booked and the sales team long gone) they are often faced with delivering something that was promised but cannot realistically be achieved. It sometimes borders on what is legal.
- Little respect for employees in lower ranks. No respect for clients at all which is worrying. Often joking about their 'stupidity' and the fact they are 'gold mines' is not very professional nor respectful."

It uses its superior ability to deliver successful projects, and it's reusable assets, along with it's quality and experienced (Human) resources and industry experience as it's selling points.

Accenture,31/10/2012, Business Analyst,"Former Employee, less than 1 year","London, England, England",1,4,1,,2,4,2,x,r,r,An uninspiring journey on the consultant conveyor belt - ACG UK,"• Good salary
• Great group of enthusiastic new hires - you are working with some seriously bright people who have perhaps been lured in by Accenture's fantastic marketing!
• Networking opportunities were frequent 
• The name opened up doors for me and helped qualify me in theory for my current job (I left after 11 months). But I didn't really learn any valuable skills to take forward!","• No project choice - you are arbitrarily put on a project/client by Schedulers without any consideration of experience or preference. Finding and moving between projects was highly political and difficult
• Just my experience but people totally abused the consultant perks - my manager harangued me for entering official team drinks expenses as drinks (because that's what they were!) rather than entering them as project related sustinence that we could charge back to the client. This client is 80% owned by the tax payer and should definitely not have foot the bill for consultants going out as a team when off site and at the end of the week
• Really very dependent on how good/bad your manager was. I had someone with limited people skills, couldn't engage the team on a project, who would regularly shaft his own team members when he messed up and similarly take the praise as his own when someone delivered something well
• Terrifyingly slow promotion and bi-annual laddering review process - I only stayed 11 months and managed to miss the laddering sessions as a new hire but I was in the rare position that I sat in on a programme laddering session with managers ranking their teams. It's highly political, with little consistency or visibility (again dependent on how good your managers and team is). Created a bad atmosphere in the team and in the end performance was hardly ever reflected in ladder position. You might get some great stars get promoted from analysts --> consultants before 2 years but this was rare. You definitely feel like you're on the conveyor belt
• Endless amounts of admin - objective review process for example was painful 
• Huge variation between roles and responsibilities. I felt like a glorified secretary, making team bookings, managing exhaustive project plans that no one looked at or stuck to, managing a risk doc that likewise was not heeded by stakeholders. Other team mates with the same bio to me could be found working weekends on testing. Some people in my intake were working on some pretty interesting projects
• Very limited client exposure - our team ended up doing the dogsbody work in the corner that no one at the client site wants to do or is interested in sadly
• No qualifications - training in Chicago was mainly methodology that wouldn't fly the real world"

Accenture,16/2/2014, Talent Acquisition,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","London, England, England",2,1,4,,4,1,4,v,v,x,Innovative company - backwards HR/Recruitment Division,"Accenture as a company are fantastic, their training and development program for consultants is amazing and if you are a high achiever you can progress very, very quickly.","Working within the HR/Recruitment team it is the most backward organisation I have ever worked for. If you apply direct to the company you will not here anything for 1 month, before being called for an interview. If this goes well, they will book you in one month later for another interview - the final step. They do not qualify salary expectations etc - so I am forced to constantly interview candidates who want £20-30,40k more than the role is paying. Who in their right mind doesnt check basics up front, like salary, location, eligibility to work in location - they will waste an entire recruitment process as they ask these questions at the LAST step. The idea of changing this is completely foreign and the team are afraid to come up with their own ideas - they simply follow process even if the process is obviously wrong. If you come up with a way to improve things you are seen as a trouble maker/difficult and trying to rock the boat. It drove me insane. I had to quit!"
Accenture,18/2/2014, Consultant,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","London, England, England",4,2,4,,5,3,4,v,v,v,All round a positive experience,"Great benefits: Gym, Pension, Company car (Manager level and above), Private health care (paid for £60,000 worth of medical bills, when insurance stopped paying Accenture paid the rest!), some very inspirational people, great social events, you learn a lot, varied work (sometimes interesting, sometimes boring), you work with some of the world's largest companies. Having Accenture on your CV opens a lot of doors for you, just be careful which doors you go through as potential employers will do and say anything to have someone with Accenture experience on their CV.","For every one good person you meet there are nine not so good people. Depending on what stage of the project you are at, you more often than not will work long hours - especially during project delivery or when you have a rubbish manager who has missed numerous targets and the client is angry. You need to remember, especially as an analyst, that clients are paying upwards of £500 per day for you to be there. So you need to know your stuff, and if you don't, find someone in Accenture's vast network who can educate you, most people will be helpful. Most clients will try and push you to your limit and ask you to go above and beyond. You need to be mindful of your own well being and learn to diplomatically manage expectations. Some members of the client organisation will be keeping a close eye on you, watch out when you take coffee breaks, and if you need to smoke then do it well away from the front door of the client's office. It should go without saying, but stay off Facebook, Twitter etc in the client office. If you feel the need to social network during the day, do it slyly on your phone, in the toilet or at lunch break.

Salaries for an Analyst range between £31-32,000, and for a Consultant £43,000+. Since leaving Accenture I have realised that this is incredibly low for the amount of work you do, and for the qualifications you no doubt have. However, you are in a privileged position if you get a job there to learn a great deal about business, sharpen your relationship management skills and generally be a bit of a boss :). 

Some people get put straight into a software / IT testing role, and hate it. It does seem a little strange at first, and if you have a non technical degree it might be difficult to get a grasp of. Testing is the least glamorous. However, I feel that spending a few months doing it is a blessing in disguise as most consulting engagements you will work on throughout your career will have an IT element, knowing about the testing process and it's importance will stand you in good stead, You will need to move on from it though as it get's a little boring, so you need to build a network to utilise to get on other projects. There's no harm in finding a partner of a particular practice and dropping them an email, or even cold calling them. Even the friends you'll make from your start group will be able to help.

The only major problem I have with Accenture is their performance management process, a forced distribution model. Someone has to get the top rating, and someone has to get the bottom rating (it's a little more complex than that). This can create a rather cut-throat atmosphere and I have experienced other people of my level being deliberately unhelpful as a result of this. That said, I worked on some projects where people didn't behave like that so it's luck of the draw.

Overall it's a fantastic experience. I wouldn't want to work for them again, but that's just me. If you have an offer from them, take it. Even if you decide you don't like consulting, there are things you can do there that will stand you in good stead for other career avenues."

Generally the best people do get promoted first.,"It is your career and nobody is going to book training for you - you have to be proactive and make that happen (not necessarily a con, more something you need to understand). 

Promotions are done as fairly as possible considering the variety of roles Consultants work on but if your line manager doesn't rate you then you are going to lose out against your peers - better to move to a different project in that case. However, don't discount how much work you need to do to ensure that those in the meeting have a good view on what you have done - over and above your line manager. 

Finally, Accenture does expect at all levels but particularly as you get more senior to manage a lot of internal work ""on the side"" in addition to your client role. This is true of all big Consultancies but be prepared for this. It can be quite tough. I can be finishing client work at 7-8pm and then working on Accenture items until midnight-1pm typically at least one to two nights a week."

Big egos that enjoy using heir position of authority to intimidate others. 
This might be obvious by now, but there is no interest in employee wellbeing. Nobody cares about you and some managers don’t even acknowledge you existence when you walk into the office unless they need you to do something. The result is low morale, fear, and a very high turnover.
Don’t be fooled by the glossy offices and the high tech look of the place. It is a soulless big corporate where you become another cog in wheel. Utterly soul crushing and negative experience. I have never been so unhappy at a job in my life."

The graduates or are offered many promotion routes as long as they tow the line and say ""yes sir"" to the right leadership (that is literally all you should do to get promoted). Any experienced hire who shows innovation and excels is held back and literally used and spat back out. Retention rate of experienced hires is extremely low for this reason. Management is very poor as graduates are promoted into these roles after a few years and lack and industry experience in management and any common sense - something they should teach the graduates is that being very bossy is not how to manage. Experienced hires (and here I mean most in middle management who haven't really been able to excel in the wide world prior to Accenture), who adopt the ""yes sir, I will do as you say I should so"" approach survive. All of these middle management are consumed with apprehension of experienced hires who show that success can be achieved outside of current business models and that moving with innovation brings even more success and therefore become awful to work for. It is also a very ""old boy's club"" environment in Accenture and it is  a great shame as the company itself could actually be a lovely place to work as most people would be proud to be part of the firm if they were shown the same level of support that a born and bred or brainwashed Accenturian is."

People: The people are generally supportive and want to help you. I have never had a problem with a manager and can be quite open with them for instance if I am not enjoying a role or experience a problem dealing with a client. 

Hours: one of the benefits relative to strategy consulting firms is the size of Accenture. You are responsible for finding your own projects. I have not been afraid to ask people currently on the project what the work hours are like and if you are expected to be out of town Mon to Fri or can work one day from home. At smaller consultancies, there are far fewer roles available so you are usually assigned by HR to a role regardless of whether it suits your needs.

Training: There are lots of training days which is great, but if you want to take any additional training which is not part of the mandatory training, this requires an MD to sponsor you (pay for it out of his or her budget) or get a project to pay for it (unlikely). 

Benefits: 30 days of annual leave in the Consulting group (United Kingdom and Ireland) which is more than any other consultancy. Maternity leave is also the best I have heard of at 9 months full pay plus you accrue annual leave during that time. 30gbp per month in subsidised gym benefit.","As a graduate, it is marketed that you can have a varied experience before specialising. However, more and more, they want you to specialise immediately after joining the company in a particular technology or industry and it is difficult to switch after, especially since roles are usually 6 months+ in length.

HR and recruitment can be not so supportive. I would say internal Accenture HR is lovely and great. However, Accenture uses a high proportion of contractors in HR and Recruitment who tend to ignore your questions.

As with many large companies, you are expected to do a lot of extra curricular activities which may or may not be related to your job but promote teamwork and learning internally and PR externally. Most people like myself find the non work related stuff to be annoying. Sometimes you do learn from doing it, but a lot of time it is time consuming and you feel you shouldn't be evaluated on these brown nosing activities."

Brand - a notable thing about Accenture is the brand name. It’s the biggest Management Consulting firm in the world the brand name is clearly one that is well renowned and so immediately it's a fantastic CV booster.
2.	Exposure – Accenture’s model relies of consultants delivering value for money for the client while also being profitable for the business, so it’s not uncommon to find yourself in a challenging role with good exposure to key projects and programmes in the industry
3.	Networking – the UK business is boasts several thousand employs so it’s a fantastic opportunity to meet new people with different skills and from a diverse set of backgrounds great for building up your own network 
4.	Work-life balance – few consulting firms will offer 30 days paid holiday along with 3 corporate volunteering days, on top of that there are several opportunities within the year to meet and have a drink on the project, the department or internal networks
5.	Training – fantastic training opportunities especially for graduates but also across the board 
6.	Perks – subsidised gym membership, corporate discounts, health check days","1.	Variance of projects - your personal well-being is very much contingent on your project and the work you do, so there is definitely a risk that is you are not placed on the right project for you then could be doing either a role you do not like or at a client / environment you do not like and this could be for a medium to long period of time. As it’s often difficult to move yourself off chargeable client work consultants may find themselves getting pigeon holed in a particular role just to meet demand. 
2.	Attrition – the positive about exposure can work in reverse if the promotions and consequential  salary hike do not keep up with the accelerated responsibility and scope of contribution; consultants can often feel demoralised doing a role “above their pay grade” causing them to consider their options and leave the firm.  
3.	Politics – like any consulting firm internal politics can influence promotion decisions as it’s often who you know rather than what you know, but this is expected for an organisation of the scale of Accenture.
4.	Competition – competition is fierce and performance reviews are forced into a distribution, often this is not the most conducive environment for teamwork"

Promotions are based on merit which is good but you need to be very good at playing the promotion game well. 
Accenture has shareholders (you included) which would like to see the value rise. This can only be done if the work is staffed which often means you may not be doing the strategy consulting you thought you'd be doing like during the interview process case studies.

The firm is open to new ideas and technologies thus creating opportunities for employees of all levels to be continuously learning and challenged. Work from home days can often be easily agreed although regular work from home is more challenging and primarily role dependent. The company has strong values and ethics and well published internal policies. The company has truly embraced the nature of being a global firm.,"A strong internal network is required in order to succeed and progress within the firm. This is most easily demonstrated when seeking new role opportunities for growth or promotion. Strident competition for best annual ratings means there is pressure to work long hours (i.e. be visible) and to be available and contactable outside traditional office hours. Executive leadership can often appear distant from the experiences being encountered by those ""on the ground""."

There are some good people and I made some friends there.","Absolutely zero work-life balance. You should expect to work late nights and weekends and get shouted at when you refuse.
General level of knowledge is extremely low. A lot of people are very confident and talk convincingly but when you scratch the surface they have absolutely no idea what they're talking about.
When you're applying for the job, Accenture HR will tell you about how you can do anything you want and how your career is completely in your hands. You soon fine out that this is nonsense, and your career direction will be completely dictated by whichever managers want to use you to get promoted.
People act like there's a huge difference between consulting and technology but really if you're performing well in technology you'll end up doing a consulting role without the salary!

- LISTEN- No senior management listens to those actually running the deal operations and usually have no idea about your current market or subject matter expertise.
- The HR department is the worst that I have ever encountered. Do not have any expectations
- Do not promote even when economically viable and the best option
- Only a small few understand the subject matter expertise being delivered to the client, but when those people see an issue related to this, a gap in the market for more services or a missed RFP, senior management do nothing because they simply don't understand the market."

Regular feedback from teams and formal reviews are helpful.  There is opportunity to work across sectors, but this has to be managed carefully to protect promotion chances (as people seem to get promoted more easily for working on the same account and projects for months / sometimes years).  Diversity is valued in the company and they are great employer for trying to keep women in the consulting industry post starting a family.","Most of the time projects are very operations and IT focused (usually working with mid to low level managers within firms).  It's therefore a very different look and feel from strategy consulting houses.  Very difficult to move away from projects that you don't like, especially if the MD looking after that account likes you.  Management more interested in selling in volume rather than choosing better engagements for its staff with the client.

I sometimes wonder why client's don't ask the individuals to explain where THEY have done whatever it is they are been hired for before, as in most cases I think we would fail to answer this without embellishing the truth.

Recruitment here generally seems to be flawed, you often come across individuals who you wonder how they got through the door, but most managers and team's tolerate this as Accenture's forced bell curve performance model forces X % of any team to be under performing so these people are used to protect the rest of the team.

IT here is terrible, most of us have 3-4 year old laptops, which are replaced on a four year cycle. Worst still is IT keep forcing updates like Office 2013 onto us which makes the machines even slower and more recently an agent which tracks everything we do (supposedly to help reduce data loss). If you do have a problem, no-one rings the offshore IT helpdesk as it's understaffed (technically and physically) so most people just use Google or let the problem remain.

Generally, if you 'brown-nose' and play the game, which most people figure out pretty quickly, then it's easy to do well here, just don't expect any support from anyone, including HR and in most cases the Senior Managers and Executives, as they are often too busy playing the game themselves!"

Also the opportunity to work with in a professional environment, with established methodologies and frameworks.","Extremely long working hours as with any management consultancy firms. Be prepared to work all day every day. The  branding is 'high performance. delivered."" This means client is king (as it should be) but you will work 24/7 in order to achieve this."
Accenture,27/2/2015, Senior Software Engineer,"Former Employee, more than 3 years","London, England, England",4,3,4,,4,3,3,v,v,v,It was amazing working with great minds. Accenture gives you the opportunity to flourish in your respective careers.,There are so many things to learn from your peers and seniors in the organization. Scope of growth is very high.,Salary is the only thing which gives you little low in the company. HR is not very helping in the company.
Accenture,5/3/2015, Software Engineering Analyst,"Former Employee, more than 1 year","London, England, England",4,2,4,,3,1,5,x,r,v,50/50 split between the good and bad points about working as a software engineer for Accenture.,"No blame culture - Nobody points a finger at you. I was never ""told off"" during my time at the company. If something goes wrong, everybody just pitches in and helps out till it's fixed.
Social - Lots of nice people, always something to take part in, great if you're single.
Build your own reputation - On your first day, if you dive right in head first you will get recognised and rewarded but you will be expected to keep up that level of hard-work. If you prefer a bit more balance, you can have that, and the expectations will drop, but the rewards won't be as forthcoming either.
Networks - Support networks are great and something I highly compliment but a little confusing. Between your buddy, HR Rep, career councillor, line manager, etc, it's hard to know who to speak to sometimes.","Terrible rewards - The pay for a software engineer is about £2-3k less than what I consider a ""good"" salary. The overtime system is awful, you get ""half-pay"" for any hours of overtime. Not time-and-a-half, but half-time. And the first 37.5 hours of that get added on to your holiday which most consider a negative.
Promotions - The promotions system is awful, pretty much coming down to how much your manager likes you at a single point during the year.
Flexible working - Never happens. If you have children, you can work flexibly, otherwise, you do whatever hours you're told to do.
Working hours - 10 hour days were common. Longest day I think I did was about 15 hours. Usually you get the next day off after a long stint like that but having software engineers working all hours of the day... there gets a point where your productivity just drops to nothing but the management never seemed to notice; so long as you're there.
Offshoring - I'd estimate that around 60-80% of the code developed offshore was of such poor quality that it needed to be overhauled/redone onshore before being deployed.
Work, work, work.... - A final note. I consider myself to be a hard working individual, but Accenture takes it to a whole new level. You pretty much have to dedicate yourself to the company/project and, if you don't, there will always be somebody who will, and they'll get a promotion, and you won't, despite the fact your quality of work is twice as good."

Interesting and challenging projects and inspiring leaders to learn from. Over the last 2 years, the company has changed dramatically.
-  The main pro was the people (senior executives to learn from and great peers to work with). However, extremely high attrition has resulted in many of them leaving the company.","How long have I got?
- Long hours - absolutely no work life balance
- Projects are poorly staffed and not scoped realistically, placing a huge amount of pressure on these left to deal with the mess 
- Lean business model has resulted in every person being stretched to breaking point to deliver to plans and costs which are completely unrealistic
- The company promotes itself as highly focussed on training and development. However, resources are so thinly stretched that you work in constant ""fire fight mode"" without any time for training or support from senior management to develop and deliver
- The complete abdication of responsibility from senior executives (at least 80% of those I have worked with do not support staff or provide adequate direction), but place huge pressure on all levels below to do their jobs for them
- Performance management and promotion system does not work. Like with every consultancy, playing the political game is key to success - but the ability to get promoted / pay is not commensurate with effort and ability"

There is a culture to promote the analysts and fresh graduates. This do not bring in fresh air and thought leadership into the company.

Long hours are appreciated and not the quality of work. In SuccessFactors there has been no successful projects so far in UK. Not many qualified resources in UK and neither the training plans are supportive. The new appraisal system introduced by the CEO is so ambiguous that even the board of directors and HR managers have no clue how this will be implemented. The new appraisal system is even more reliant on managers to rate employees, just another way to promote favouritism.Career opportunities are low. You neither get exposure to grow up not a hands on configuration experience as everything is offshored. The consultants in UK are mere coordinators and lack any consulting or successfactors skills.

- Get to travel and visit places
- Develop your presentation and communication skills
- Makes you more of a brutal person generally (career wise)","- A nightmare if you end up on the worong career track i.e In siolutions the renumeration is frankly a disgrace.
- Gaining promotion is an exhaustive process 
- Have to maintain a close relationship with the right people to progress.
- Also an unethical culture exist were individuals are brought from offshore to carry out work in th the UK at a pittance and certain element of exploitation exist."
Accenture,21/4/2016, Analyst,"Current Employee, less than 1 year","Leeds, England, England",5,4,5,,5,5,5,v,o,v,Great company to work for!,"I joined as an Analyst straight from University.  I joined right onto Accenture's Graduate program which was made up of two weeks London based training and then two weeks international training where I went to Chicago (there is an alternative option of going to India).  This whole process was amazing and I was put with around 70 others within my start group.  The training was excellent and now I have been working within the company for a longer period of time I can confirm that the training was very comprehensive and really did prepare us for the type of work and scenarios that we have been placed in.  And some of the friends and experiences and events within the company have been amazing.  It is both organised and well structured for everything you can ask for.  

The people within Accenture really do make it special I would like to think that I have made some amazing friends for life from within the company.  The work is also interesting and varied and even if you do not like the project to which you are first placed upon you can leave at around 8 months to something new.  Within Accenture networking and going to events is key to getting onto an exciting and dynamic project.  I myself made friends with a consultant whilst in Chicago and was placed into a project within my first week at Accenture.  

Also the opportunities to network and meet people from different areas of the company are ample and all you need do is seek them out and its as easy as that and due to the vast nature of the company it is easy to talk to people with a lifetimes experience spanning a breadth of different industries.  The networks and societies also are fantastic, I joined the LGBT in week one and they are fantastic and provide ample events, charities to get involved in, friends and an amazing insight into London.  Any one looking to join Accenture need only look up what they are most interested in and I can tell you there will be a network or society to sign up to. 

Ohh and the benefits are pretty great, basis salary of £31,5000 and a bonus of £10,000.  Generous share plan, health insurance, amazing pension plan, expense account and expense card which racks me up on BA air miles and the amount of hotel reward points I now have is amazing.  There are loads of other benefits but these can be looked up.","The cons I would say come with the territory, longer than average working hours, although not horrific.  A lack of time spent at home due to living in hotels for 3-4 days a week depending on the project to which you are placed and the ramifications this does have on ones social life.  I myself have had to turn down some amazing events in London and night with my friends due to being places on my project at the moment outside of London.  However if I did want to move to a role based in London there is the opportunity to do this at some point if I find I am no longer happy being away from home for so long."

- Few other Consultancies work with the same Major Clients

- Outside the UK's over-regulated markets, Accenture really does work on new technologies and frontiers....and you can read about it internally.

- Generally speaking, you can get lots of training / certifications

- Good place to go from Analyst => Consultant => Manager

- Its a IT and Project Management company trying to pose as a Business Consultancy. But you really do work with the Best Project managers I have ever come across.

- The Managing Directors (again for the most part) do seem to genuinely care for the people and do sort things out when an issue is bought to them. The Process for becoming an MD is far more stringent than the lower level promotions and definitely comes off more objective.","- It generally takes an experienced hire a year to learn the Accenture game, by which time they are usually on the back foot, have a bad rating and better off leaving 6 months later. After all - externally, you're Accenture stained by then anyway. For most people that adds value to their CV.

- Lack of transparency around staffing. The best roles get filled by network - and if you're new, you have no network. And if you're unlucky, you join and get sent to the middle of no where by yourself for a year and then really are screwed.

- Accenture career-lifers are ignorant to the outside world and new people entering into their cliques, which makes it difficult for the company to change or develop

- Real lack of ideas. The company is full of Sales people and blow-hards, but not much content

- Too much focus on doing internal Accenture work instead of actual client work. 

- People with the title Manager are a Rank and not actual Managers. It confers they are good at doing internal Accenture work more than they actually know how to Manage something.... especially people.

- Low pay rises to no pay rises despite the company saying it is doing well year on year (Accenture is not seen as advisory vs the Big 4 so gets squeezed on day rates and on the other side is now competing with the big 6 of India for the IT work who bring low day rates too). Limited pay increases within Rank.

- Focus on being a salesman first vs building actual expertise which Clients would pay more for

- Lots of snakes in suits - too much of an ""I"" culture and no real collaboration. The performance process focuses too much on individuals and so there is a culture of not wanting to share ideas or work together as you can't claim credit.

- The objectives / priorities system doesn't matter - all that matters is what is said about you in the laddering / talent discussions i.e. have some Snr Mgrs and MDs who like you and you'll go up easy enough, with or without talent

- Boring work - If you have come from outside, the work is really vanilla. It might be big in scale, but really, its basic work. 

- lots of internal processes which no one cares about - great fill out your internal profile, CV, blog etc - but no one actually cares. 

- Moving around Accounts is career limiting, unlike other places where you're bringing new ideas and expertise to clients

- Cost cutting on training in the past few years (no Chicago, less annual budget for real skills, no real quality training on industry topics)"

Accenture,1/2/2017, Analyst,"Current Employee, more than 1 year","London, England, England",4,3,2,,5,4,3,x,v,v,Good opportunities if you're willing to fight for them,"1) Flexibility. The firm is ultimately governed 'bottom-up' (by employee base) rather than 'top-down' (by leadership). Relationship building always trumps job description and formal policy. I've staffed myself on good projects, and whilst HR and management might not always endorse these moves (partly to prevent all-out chaos), their hard policies have limited coverage. This is a good mix of creating paths of least resistance that benefit the overall firm, whilst also keeping opportunities open for you if you're good and self-motivated. This is arguably a positive side-effect of some systemic problems within the firm.
2) Above market rate salary.
3) Excellent managers: people at the manager and senior manager level have been unilaterally great. Junior enough to care, but senior enough to materially help out. 
4) Pockets of progressive policy, such as promotion discussions and performance evaluations (although implementation has something to be desired).
5) Diverse opportunities. Accenture is a huge professional services firm. They do everything from old IBM mainframe maintenance, to M&A due diligences, to marketing. What you're after is probably here.
6) Easy to move on. Even if things don't work out (e.g. an immovable policy blocks your progression within the firm) the experiences and skills learnt are easy to sell (after all, ACN does a bit of everything)!","The key driver of all the below problems is that consulting at Accenture (and perhaps the wider UK market) is highly commodified.

1) Lack of investment: particularly on benefits, training and office capacity (only 2 weeks of fairly austere onboarding, no phone provided, not enough desks in Fenchurch Street, tight controls on expenses, limited event budgets, few opportunities to work abroad).
2) Poor quality analysts: generally boring and lacking rigour (typical 2:i graduates from mid-table universities with a sports team and summer internship on their CV).
3) Poor quality projects: Accenture's bread-and-butter for new joiners are PMO and solutions roles on chunky systems integration projects that can last 1+ years. It's common in the firm to have spent your entire career working for a single client. This to me is not a consulting business, but a glorified job agency. You have to fight against the current to avoid these roles and go for the more 'interesting' work, which is definitely out there.
4) Demoralising and byzantine HR policy and controls. Most of this can be avoided (see pro above), but if you don't fight or get unlucky, company policy can railroad you. I personally joined on a management consulting offer, only for it to be converted in a tech consulting offer (upon day 2 on the job) - and HR lied to me on record about the change. This would be a bigger issue but it hasn't affected my career progression so far. Also: anxiety-inducing pressure from utilisation and changeability targets, poor scheduler relationships, and demands to engage in a narrow set of sanctioned extra-curriculars.
5) Bad reputation within consulting."

Over the past 2 years a number of significant changes have happened within Accenture. 

Most notably, 
- Merging of Solutions workforce into Consulting
- Move away from the 'forced rankings' into a Performance Achievement model
- Market relevant roles and pay structures - plus bonuses and rewards that recognise exceptional contributions
- Shift into bringing cutting-edge technology and innovation to our clients/projects - and providing incentives, trainings to the entire workforce to facilitate this thinking across all levels","The mindset change of the performance appraisal has not yet fully permeated throughout the organisation.

It's employment conditions and perks are very good compared to others, certainly one of the best in my experience. 

Community spirit is strong (circles, networking events, associations etc). Whilst everybody benefits from this, there is a particularly strong (and deservedly well respected) focus on women and the LGBT community (which is great to be part of and in no way detracts or acts to the detriment of people outside of these groups).

Working from home is positively encouraged which is well received and helps family and work/life balance.","The bureaucracy is simply mind-numbing. Getting even the simplest thing done in terms of admin, recruitment, invoice payment etc is often a monumental task and takes hours of precious time. It also seems to involve at least 10 people being copied into every email, but nobody seems able to troubleshoot problems (when you do find somebody who can, it is well worth adding them to your contacts list or speed dial so you can circumvent the usual hurdles every time). Most frustratingly of all, when you have spent hours accomplishing something that should take a few moments and the click of a mouse, you will be asked for the same task or information two weeks later by people who should already have it.

The health insurance and maternity/paternity benefits are strong. Those in the most senior managerial positions are paid handsomely in terms of remuneration, shares and other benefits (although the same cannot be said for the other 95% of employees).

Could offer you a career for life if you’re prepared to be at the mercy of performance process which doesn’t award ability or achievement – see Cons below.","The epitome of a corporate behemoth which is too big to offer employees the true nurturing and career progression everyone deserves. Nothing about Accenture feels personal – you really are just another number in a huge multinational machine. As someone who has a great deal of professional experience, I’ve never worked anywhere which made me feel so unimportant as Accenture. It really lacks a soul. If you are joining, or already have, and soon after feel that the company is not the right place for you – leave! Your client(s) or role(s) are important in shaping your experience within Accenture, but ultimately if the company’s culture, ethos and its people feel foreign to you, then escape quickly and without regret. 

Accenture sells a dream and delivers something far short of that. The training offered is sub-par to competing firms by quite some distance, something which is particularly obvious to clients when they meet recent joiners to the company. Accenture also fail to utilise employees’ previous experience – for example why would you force someone with years of Resources industry expertise into a Financial Services role – because you need a number to fill a role and really don’t care who that individual is. Failure to offer people the true ability to build on their experiences and shape their career is one reason why so many people decide to leave. It’s also worth saying that your working hours are entirely dependent on client, location and role, so this really is pot luck – some people really do end up with an intolerable work-life balance.
 
If you’re prepared to perform significantly above the level at which you’re paid to, and wait for the overly restrictive performance achievement process to promote you up the career ladder then Accenture is a company that could offer you a career for life. However don’t be fooled, Accenture is not a meritocracy - very talented individuals will not necessarily progress much more rapidly than those who consistently just do enough year-on-year. Long-time employees I met who (at least said they) enjoyed working for Accenture, where those with an almost robotic approach to their work and their career. I truly believe that those who benefit the most from being at Accenture long-term, are the shareholders."

They pay good benefits such as half your gym membership. They often bring in free pizza etc if targets are being met. Mostly superficial things really though.","Awful culture, bias and favouritism leads to promotion, rather than genuine knowledge, skill or experience. Claim to be a company who value innovation, meritocracy and people who think outside of the box, but this couldn't be further from the truth. They don't care about their employees they just care about delivering results (on paper) to clients, and gaining more business. To do so they just want 'yes' people who ask no questions and are willing to take blame for any and all of managements shortcomings. Management have no skills, purely in their position because of cliquey relationships leading to promotion. Worst experience ever."

I felt like I ended up in the wrong part of the business - my first assignments weren't a perfect fit for my recent studies.

Or you need to go with the flow and learn what you can until you get the opportunity you are after. I guess it depends on the kind of person you are.

There is loads of training available. If you are lucky, some can be abroad. But it can sometimes be tricky getting permission to attend. Client work takes priority over training. 

In general, a nice, inclusive culture. Plenty of socials, if that is your thing. 

You get to effectively work for a bunch of different companies/clients and see what it is like to work for those companies.","One reason I joined was for the opportunity to travel, ideally abroad. In reality, this is quite hard to do and only happens if there are no roles in the U.K. that your skills could be used in, i.e. you don't get to go abroad because you would like to, only if there is a business need to do so. 

Commutes can be long - you are expected to commute up to 2 hours each way. Anything more and a hotel may be used. 2 hours may seem fine, but it really does wear you down over the months. And you end up with not much of a life during the week. 

Software engineers are not first class citizens at Accenture - consultants are. So, rather unfairly, software engineers get a lower salary and less holiday than a consultant at the same level - though software engineers do get limited overtime. If you apply as a grad and you have done computer science, you are funnelled into this lower paying area even though it may not be the area you applied for. 

The skill of the majority of the software engineers/developers in the company is not great and they generally focus on packaged applications rather than wiring actual code. Though, there are a few people who are very skilled and it is great to be able to learn from them - if you can find them. The entry interviews barely tested your skills, indeed, 1/3 of the software engineering grads I started with hadn't coded before... though they do train you up.

Client work is the priority and late nights/weekends can become the norm on some projects. 

Below average salary for software engineers, especially in London. 

Your first role is key to deciding your future roles at Accenture. You become known for your primary skill and will be placed on roles using this skill in the future. So it is hard to try out new skills, at least by choice. Within a project, you can often end up doing things not related to the role you joined the project up for."

- Good perks (especially retailer discounts which add up)
- Nice showers in the London office for jogger/cycle commuters
- Plenty of training available
- Good exposure (as with any consultancy) to decision makers at client companies
- Someone will have already written a powerpoint deck for whatever your project proposal or bid is.  Guaranteed.
- Making major efforts to increase BAME and female representation at all levels; these are starting to have a desired effect but this will have to be maintained on a permanent basis
- Extremely good LGBTQ awareness; Stonewall has recognised them as one of the best employers in the UK for it.  A large proportion of the LGBTQ employees are openly out (including UK board members).","- It's very hard to integrate from industry if you've never been a consultant before.  I got 2.5 days training to understand the basics of how Accenture works.  They tell you it takes 12 months to figure the company out.  They are right, and that's only if you have support to help understand it.  I didn't.
- Management can be very hit and miss.  In other departments I found them highly approachable (even the UK MD Olly was approachable and supportive when I needed his time despite having thousands of people working for him).  My own management team were awful; my line manager (MD level) didn't communicate with me via any medium for the final 8 months of my time with Accenture. 
- Training is available but only if you're free to do it.  Everyone is supposed to get a week of training; many did not due to client demands.
- Work life balance can be poor.  At one stage my client refused to allow me to take any vacation for 8 months and only acquiesced when an EMEA level senior MD intervened.  Travel can be brutal; I took a 7 hour flight home from an overseas assignment just to be able to snatch a day and a half with family before having to fly back.
- I was told I wasn't performing to expectations but wasn't given an explanation what was required nor any assistance (e.g. training or refresher) to address the gap.
- Very cliquey.  You're either in with management or you're on a slippery slope to the exit.  It might take 12-18 months to get there, but you will.
- Growing incredibly fast; too fast in my opinion.  A breather from acquisitions would be a good idea to streamline and prevent overlaps and get rid of under performing management at SM and MD level.
- When I left, strategy had lost its head and had nothing in the pipeline.  This is going to be unhelpful for the other departments (consulting, digital, etc).
- Frequently tried to shoehorn me into industries and job roles that I had no knowledge of.  It's a bit like trying to get an insurance specialist to assist in the migration of a currency trading operation from London to Frankfurt."

If you are an experienced hire, you may find out that you are paid the same rate as a graduate with 0 experience (happened to me personally). Within Consultancy, don't accept the title ""Analyst"" as it is a junior role. You don't get bonuses and no benefits. You'll find members who only have 2yrs experience titled ""Consultants"" because they joined the company as graduates and got promoted! While your 5yrs of experience put you below these members! When I raised this to HR, they said ""Take it or leave it"".
* Their poor ethics means they'll sell you to the client as a ""Consultant"" and claim that much money from the client for your hours, but you'll only be paid an ""analyst"" rate! So all the money will be pocketed by your senior management who sold you for that price lying to the clients.
* HR will do everything they can to under pay you. Employee satisfaction isn't their concern.  You might think this is the same everywhere, but that's not true. I negotiated my new salary with my current employer (not Accenture) and their offer was even more than i asked for!
* When it comes to performance, favouritism plays a major role on who gets promoted. You'll need to make yourself visible to management directors (very hard to reach) to get their support, no matter how hardworking you are, and no matter how much feedback you get from your client! Not only that, if your line manager who supports your promotion doesn't have a loud voice (+ a senior manager whom everyone wants to please) and isn't as pushy during promotion meetings, you'll be sitting in the same level for yrs!
* Employees come and leave within 1.5 yrs! You don't feel any value or connection to the company. 
* Their HR doesn't communicate well within themselves. When i first joined I told the senior management that i had agreed with the interviewers that I will join the specialist group (in the operational tower), but they put me in the (technical tower) saying ""this is where we need you, and we don't *like* moving employees to other towers"". But I'm a specialist in something the whole of UK has desperate shortage of! Why would you dismiss my 5yrs speciality when you're trying to build the operations team? When i eventually moved (6months later) to the operations tower (because that tower escalated to get on me on board), the HR for that tower was very surprised how all of this had happened. Well poor communications! Every HR wants to recruit and improve her/his numbers rather than prioritise the company's need and put ppl in place where they will last in the company!
* They set unrealistic deadlines by selling work they can't deliver, and make you work day and night and you can't claim overtime because the contract you signed is fixed with no overtime! Read the contract carefully if you are part of the consultancy stream."

-Incredible learning opportunities on challenging assignments with a variety of leading multinational clients -- an amazing place to learn great skills and talents which are respected by clients and the external business world -- a great opportunity for younger professionals that want to accelerate their career over a few years
-Interesting and rewarding work when staffed on projects in chosen subject area with respectful teams and work that is properly scoped (e.g. not under-priced to win the work, this leads to everyone working like dogs for months on end)
-Some projects really do yield great results for clients, and you get to know senior client stakeholders well (if MDs get out of the way)
-Some pockets of smart colleagues and great teams that support each other and shield colleagues from the negatives to some degree
-Although the work life balance is unpredictable, you can take very deliberate steps to balance this, if you learn when to say no or ask for help -- although this may impact progression
-Pay and benefits are pretty good but could be better given the demanding and often shifting workload","-Must exercise care when networking with teams, managers, career counsellors -- the only way to be treated fairly and work on projects you enjoy is to find the right sponsors and advocates, otherwise you may get lost in the business on endless projects with very poor working conditions and substandard teams
-Accenture talks a big game about meritocracy and being human but talent management is a second-thought joke; formal reviews and coaching are lacklustre unless you have a career counsellor that really cares, the entire promotion process is unmeritocratic, deeply political, and driven by spreadsheets rather than rewarding individual progress -- a stressful and endless Game of Thrones
-Accenture has a retention problem; best talent is squandered through politics and lack of meritocracy; worst talent not always managed out; as a result, ~50% of managers and above are simply adequate or actually hold good people in their teams back
-Some senior managers and MDs don't understand how to build, run and retain high-performing teams, or frankly don't have time to care,  given very challenging growth and margin targets
-Enormous non-client facing demands and time at manager level and above, often on internal tasks, politicking and ""positioning"" that yields little value

By 2018, all serious companies know they need to keep their IT branch in-house. The only companies who are naive enough to hire consultants like Accenture are the ones who have no clue what they are doing. 

You will take part in non engaging projects and will have very poorly skilled colleagues.

- although there are a lot of good people, people that have been there a long time can become absolutely crazy and lose sight of what’s important - the client!  (no exaggeration here) 

- if you happen to know the right senior people you could get on interesting projects and see promotions however, those senior people often times are so focused on sales they won’t care about their employees 

- although hours are based on the client, depending on your senior managers / directors you could be doing up to 100hour work weeks consistently (real personal experience) 

- it is well known that HR and the people that schedule consultants onto projects often see consultants as numbers and will be really make you feel that

- most people don’t actually seem very happy 

- performance review period is lacks transparency and often times doesn’t seem to be very well organised 

- I was mostly on some of the more interesting projects however, I know a lot of people were working on projects that are very BAU / uninteresting

- it is widely recognised that the Financial services culture within consulting is terrible and attempts to fix it have failed 

- in my experience you’re sold onto projects without the right training or knowledge and expected to succeed, if you don’t you’re will be overlooked 

- career counsellors represent you in your promotion discussions, if they do not have the most influence in the room your career progression will likely suffer

Opportunity to build some good networks and lifelong friendships - the people are really nice.

Looks good on your CV for future external opportunities.","I worked for Accenture as an EA for over 5 years.

The EA model needs a complete overhaul, there are too many inexperienced EA Supervisors who have no people management skills and are only there to relay information from the top. 

Pay for this role is poor compared to other companies. Minimal pay rises of 1.5% per year with no bonus eligibility whatsoever. 

Annual performance reviews have no impact on your salary reviews; you can work hard all year round and receive a brilliant review to then be told there’s not enough in the EA pot to go round. The reviews should be carried out by the actual bosses you work for which is not the case.

There are far too many EAs so you feel as though you are part of a factory run process; therefore promotions are very sparse. They have implemented some form of an EA promotion system which they change as they go along. The few promotions are mainly awarded to EAs already supporting more senior bosses. You can name the EA promotions before the opportunities even arise.

Accenture has some brilliant EAs who work and have worked for the company and their efforts continuously go unrecognised and unrewarded so it’s a real shame."

Takes care of people who join through their grad programme - these people get promoted through the ranks fairly quickly
 Breadth of technical work
Known for doing large complex transformations","Based on my own experience as well as  conversations with a large number of current & former Accenture staff, 90% of lateral hires, especially at senior levels have a bad experience - the lateral hires at manager/ senior manager grade last 1.5 -2  years in the company.
Does not matter how good the lateral hire is, good opportunities are given  to people who who have joined the grad programme and come up through the ranks, to the detriment of the lateral hire.
Progression within the company is based on relationships & tenure rather than capability.  The managing director level is a 50:50 mix of really capable people and people of no exceptional capability who have been promoted for no reason other than having joined the company in their grad programme and promoted based on tenure. 
Accenture has never really moved away from the laddering/ forced bell curve fitting approach to annual performance evaluations. Whilst it can be argued that this approach removes the weakest performers and hence improves performance of the company overall, the implementation is deeply flawed.  People are put into the top and bottom performer segments based on relationships & tenure within the company instead of performance factors like client impact, delivery, quantum of sales or client relationships."

- Expenses are fairly generous and you can persuade HR to pay for specific training fairly easily as they don't have any idea what training would be good for any of the technical roles .
- You can truly get away with doing sweet FA if they over-saturate the bench with grad intakes.
- Most employees are knowledgeable and understanding of LGBT+. I didn't encounter any outdated ways of thinking about these subjects whilst I was there.","I joined the ""Software Engineering Graduate Scheme"" but it was no such thing. Our starting group of graduates got split down the middle into technical-ish and admin; however all technical-ish graduates got put into a training course for a specific specialism that there were not enough roles for in the actual company.
I had low expectations for Accenture being the MegaCorp that it is - however,  its brand of ""software consulting"" means that consultant BS to clients trickles down into the bottom line.

Other cons:
- Terrible management and ""talent specialist"" employees: If you have any technical skill such as specific programming languages/stacks or software then there will be no attempt made to utilise you, as the people managing the role conveyor belt don't have knowledge about tech roles or skills. Exhibit A being the role adverts using ""Java"" and ""Javascript"" interchangeably... and seemingly never being noticed. This means you'll just get pushed into any old role that sounds ""about right,"" but will risk you encountering Accenture's Kiss of Death.
- Their adverts regarding ""New Applied Now"" could not be further from the truth (but obviously all career adverts for companies like this are just fluff). As the various technical implementations I got to see were huge spaghetti code monstrosities described as ""systems"" built with various older languages using (from what I'd seen) non-existent IDEs. Which were, due to longer projects, Frankensteined together in a panic-inducing fashion.
- First few weeks you get to hear of the fabled ""diamond"" (dinosaur) clients. It very quickly becomes apparent that these are simply companies that have invested too much time and money in contracts with Accenture to pull out and make a mess in their shareholder's hair.
- As with all companies based in tech, management tend to have either lost their technical knowledge or had none prior to begin with. So you get to deal with explaining to consultants why you can't just copy and paste a couple wiki pages on ""Machine Learning"" (no more specific than that of course) into a PowerPoint and submit that to clients as a ""sprint plan."""

Pay is not in line with the market and I have experienced more junior males being readily promoted above females in some areas, who have predominantly male executive teams making the decisions. This is unfortunate considering the external propaganda released on inclusion and diversity. ( I wish they played by the standards set out in those videos!)

The model is to burn out bright young energetic people and then replace them with new graduates, who they can pay more cheaply yet will charge clients a high margin for those people and encourage others to resign.

Project deadlines don't move even when dependencies have been missed or the project has not been staffed fully, and the delivery team always ends up making ends meet through putting in lots of extra hours.
Being successful is hugely a case of 'upwards management' and is mainly down to the how influential your career counsellor is and how far they will back you. The result is generations of project managers who understand nothing about the projects they are managing because they were promoted too early and move freely between subject areas.
Projects are often sold to you as being very innovative and exciting but end up being the same old same old because nobody budgeted for enough time to do anything beyond a tactical house of cards solution."

Based solely on your network and who you know. Very little of your actual performance or feedback from direct line managers taken into account. Building your  ‘personal brand’ is the primary concern of the company from day one, which encourages people to cosy up to management who will help them through promotion, rather than focussing on building up useful skills. 
- incredibly competitive and toxic culture, particularly in ACG. To be expected when you are ranked against one another during performance review 
- analysts have no say in shaping their career - schedulers and management only care about charge-ability.  If you turn down unsuitable roles you will be penalised. 
- analysts are taken advantage of by senior staff eg forced to work on clients without a chargeable code, which is then used against them at performance review 
- questionable management of the recent redundancy process - Accenture now having to rehire multiple roles, no senior management pay cuts etc 
- it looks bad to be throwing countless freebies at your employees whilst laying off 6% of the UK workforce

Watch out for when they sell you as a senior consultant and pay you an analyst rate.
No matter how many years you spend (think 7 years), other 'favourits', will get their training paid for, and you won't.
Favourism is a real problem. If you aren't good at selling yourself and talking about your work, and much better at delivering, you'll be overshadowed by management, who will get their bonus for your work, and you'll get nothing, because someone else is claiming your work! And sometimes, you'll have a colleague you know does virtually nothing throughout the day, but spends most of his time having a laugh with management, he gets promoted and you don't :)
This is even worse when you know that you can't represent yourself in promotion meetings, and your senior management (who will usually have no clue what you're doing, thanks to your manager claiming your work), and you won't even get a salary increase beyond 200-300 a year!!
They didn't care to promote women, in 2018 they promoted 5 ppl, all were men! Questioning them, they failed to explain why 2 were promoted over another lady in the team. She was yet another person who wasn't good at selling her work, but she worked hard and everyone knew she was great.

I should write in the Pros that this place, taught me what I'm actually worth the hard way and to not allow them or anyone else to benefit from my work if they won't pay me. Look elsewhere if you're looking to feel valued and not just a number that increases their bonuses. Great experience is everywhere believe me, now that I left, I've learnt much more in the last year than I did in the last two years."

- Nearly not enough projects for all hires. I understand the churn rate in consulting, but firing people because they cannot find a project, while being a junior team member is questionable.

Can be incredibly hierarchical - but not necessarily pinned to level, depends who likes you. People no matter how good their background and output is are essentially told to 'shut up and make it look pretty', that they 'don't know anything' by very mediocre people rehashing non-sensical ideas in front of clients, or just repeating things they've heard and using consulting jargon to mask things. It's very much a taker culture, full of backstabbing, especially around promotion time. They don't care about people, you are just your employee number. They pay lipservice to all the right things but good luck finding action to actually back it up around things like diversity, work-life balance and mental health. It's mainly marketing, show pony-ism and people stealing other people's ideas while telling them their worth nothing. Disgraceful culture - filled with people who don't even bother to report harassment because they don't feel they'd get much help, particularly if the perpertrators are perceived to be company favourites. Senior people who won't report incidents of people using offensive language around protected characteristics, or intimidating employees who've called these things out (admittedly this seems like a bigger problem in the larger parts of the business), but will go on linkedin and post about their commitment to diversity and promote the completion of conduct surveys, citing that bad behaviour should be called out.

- You cannot possibly drive your own career - forced to take up any role to maintain chargeability, even if you are up for promotion you will be judged by strangers via multiple discussion rounds, opaque talent discussion process - career counsellor puts you up for promotion but at the end you don't end up getting promoted and there is no formal reason/feedback for the same!
- Career heavily dependent on Networking - you can be a rockstar in your client account but if you are not friends with seniors, leads or anyone who sits in the talent discussion rounds - well tough luck! Finding good roles is also based on knowing the 'correct' people. This is stressful and can easily impact the actual work you need to do to excel. Also sometimes this can be very unfair as if a person is not good at their work and do not possess the relevant skills but excellent networking skills as opposed to someone who is actually very good at their work - the latter will always have a disadvantage and can take ages to climb up the ladder.
- No clarity on different streams - people with good technical background and skills start on level 12 and people who have background in music, geography, biology, chemistry, math etc. start at level 11 because Accenture does not appreciate graduates who have computer science degrees and relevant experience!"

Excellent place to start a career as you can find what you like and what you do not like. There is a strong sense of identity which can be nice if that is what you are looking for.,"Despite what Accenture says, obtaining interesting projects is often based on luck. As there is a 0 bench policy, people are encouraged to take whichever project is available. This is not ideal if you want to follow a particular direction. There is also a general expectation to do a lot of extra curriculum activities (read as free work to support more senior people in their sales efforts) to stand ""out"".

- Great opportunity to get certified in anything. They offer a range of services and tools to enable that.
- If you're a recent Graduate, don't mind climbing the corporate ladder, love to work anytime of the day and evening, you'll feel at home.","1. Full of office politics;
2. You find yourself living to work rather than working to live;
3. When it comes to performance review time, it gets quite stressful because, it's a sales speech, and most of the times, the one who has actually worked and contributed more don't get promoted, at the end of the day is 'how well the managers or senior managers in your bubble know you';
4. Managers feel like gods and can get very disrespectful and inconsiderate, in many occasions, they've put people on performance improvement simply for not wanting to work overtime or wanting to leave a project they're not happy with;
5. Arrogant leadership;
6. Mediocre pay;
7. Coming from a minority background, On three occasions I've had white managers and team leads happily saying the 'N word' in front of me while others just laughed, which goes without saying the feeling of disrespect felt (Being new and junior in the company I was afraid to speak out), on a different situation, a team lead said to me 'don't go for white girls they don't tend to like big-nosed people' while asking for my dating situation;
8. People at senior level than others feel the need to step/look down on people;
9. You'll find yourself knowing more than someone at a higher level than you, which goes back to point number 3;
10. Unnecessary extra-curricular work which is crucial to getting promoted, the more you do the better, and you easily find yourself not having time for actual client work;
11. Leadership don't care about juniors of Level 11-12, have once been around a group of managers in a pub, a group of junior colleagues (level 11-12) passed by to say 'Hi' after they're gone a manager loudly says 'F-word TAGs' (TAG is the denomination for anyone who's of associate/analyst level). All other managers, team leads, Senior managers simply laughed;
12. No humanity, if you're lucky enough you find yourself in great projects with actual nice people but it's extremely rare, it's easier to find a crypto-wallet full of Bitcoin on the side of the road.
13. Have worked on a Financial services' project with a very lovely and friendly group of Indian developers on ICT visas, the senior managers were the true definition of bullies, on one occasion calling one of the developers (who's around 38-40 years old) dumb and useless in front of the team. Which goes back to point number 5 and 8.
14. Leadership are like presidential candidates, they know how to use their words to keep you at ease.
15. Get ready to be a Yes-Man in order to be promoted

Final Tip: 
 - It's not about working hard, just know your people, make yourself known to managers and senior managers; 
 - Talk a lot even if it doesn't make sense;
 - Make sure you show the personality that's ready to step or disrespect others anytime, it'll show to leadership you're ready to lead."

For the time I worked there they were always understaffed, there is too much pressure on employees, lack of training and high expectations. 
The shifts are constantly changing, you can't have a balance or social life, although some people got special treatment and all the days off/holidays they wanted. 
There is a lack of communication, teamwork, and appreciation. They expect everything from you and don't teach you enough. There is the staff who have been there for 5 years who don't know basic things and are still learning. If you wanted to know how to do something you had to ask, and everyone is very reluctant to help you. The managers aren't there so you have lots of responsibilities and have to fix problems without knowing how to. This is visible to the guests, who are constantly disappointed.
